00:34.034 --> 00:38.631
<i>Long before the birth of light,
there was darkness.</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:42.839
<i>And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:48.432
<i>Millennia ago,
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:53.437
<i>sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.</i>

00:55.889 --> 01:00.611
<i>Such evil was possible
through the power of the Aether,</i>

01:00.811 --> 01:04.486
<i>an ancient force of infinite destruction.</i>

01:07.558 --> 01:08.943
Malekith.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.662
Asgard's forces are upon us.

01:19.079 --> 01:23.380
<i>The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:26.424
<i>waged a mighty war
against these creatures.</i>

01:37.389 --> 01:39.687
Send in the Kursed!

01:56.491 --> 01:59.368
<i>As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:03.840
<i>Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.</i>

02:18.055 --> 02:19.147
Ahh!

02:21.975 --> 02:25.229
<i>But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.</i>

02:26.271 --> 02:28.444
<i>Without it, the Dark Elves fell.</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:44.923
<i>With the battle all but lost,</i>

02:45.207 --> 02:47.585
<i>Malekith sacrificed his own people</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:52.468
<i>in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to Asgard's army.</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:57.644
Their deaths will mean our survival.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.098
This war is far from over.

03:08.730 --> 03:14.328
<i>Malekith was vanquished,
and the Aether was no more.</i>

03:15.362 --> 03:17.239
<i>Or so we were led to believe.</i>

03:18.699 --> 03:22.044
Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?

03:22.703 --> 03:25.081
If only we could.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.090
But its power is too great.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.169
Bury it deep.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.717
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.551
Loki.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.264
Hello, Mother.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.637
Have I made you proud?

04:19.801 --> 04:22.179
Please, don't make this worse.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.105
Define "worse."

04:24.264 --> 04:25.857
Enough!

04:26.016 --> 04:28.314
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.709
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.

04:44.868 --> 04:48.247
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?

04:48.371 --> 04:51.215
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,

04:51.875 --> 04:53.377
and death.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.764
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.100
Just like you.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.055
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.602
Just as humans do.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.935
Give or take 5,000 years.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.856
All this because Loki desires a throne.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.365
It is my birthright.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.869
Your birthright was to die

05:19.361 --> 05:20.908
as a Child.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.499
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.628
If I had not taken you in,

05:28.787 --> 05:31.415
you would not be here now to hate me.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.791
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

05:33.792 --> 05:36.295
just swing it.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.671
It's not that I don't
love our little talks,

05:38.672 --> 05:40.595
it's just...

05:41.675 --> 05:43.348
I don't love them.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.761
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

05:45.762 --> 05:47.184
and you will never see her again.

05:48.098 --> 05:52.399
You will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.650
And what of Thor?

05:58.275 --> 06:01.870
You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.532
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.219
He will bring order to the Nine Realms

06:07.367 --> 06:09.335
and then, yes...

06:10.245 --> 06:12.168
He will be king.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.008
- Ah!

06:59.544 --> 07:01.262
I've got this completely under control!

07:01.421 --> 07:03.469
Is that why everything is on fire?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.439
Ah!

07:27.489 --> 07:29.036
You're welcome.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.702
Ha!

07:50.720 --> 07:51.767
All yours.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.370
Hello.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.295
I accept your surrender.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.522
Anyone else?

08:42.397 --> 08:45.947
Perhaps next time
we should start with the big one.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.158
Keep moving. Come on!

09:00.623 --> 09:03.092
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!

09:04.127 --> 09:05.879
Where do we go next?

09:06.046 --> 09:10.017
Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.683
You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.438
Asgard can wait.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.816
You have my thanks.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.649
As you have mine.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.450
Heimdall, when you're ready.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.368
Is Vanaheim secure?

10:14.531 --> 10:15.999
As are Nornheim and Ria.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.841
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

10:19.577 --> 10:23.878
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.126
That was not my intent.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.710
For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,

10:28.711 --> 10:30.509
the Nine Realms are at peace.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.095
They're well reminded of our strength

10:33.258 --> 10:37.970
and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.097
Thank you.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.725
Nothing out of order

10:41.975 --> 10:45.024
except your confused
and distracted heart.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.439
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.496
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.689
You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.

10:54.369 --> 10:56.113
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,

10:56.114 --> 10:57.239
but as your father.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.241
You are ready.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.373
The time has come
for you to take the throne.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.245
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.454
Join your warriors.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.924
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.386
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.632
Another!

12:12.857 --> 12:15.861
There was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks.

12:17.195 --> 12:20.290
I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin

12:20.406 --> 12:22.659
so much that you nearly
started the second.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.328
Well, the first was so much fun.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.841
Take a drink with me.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.011
Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.016
No, this is one I set myself.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.060
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.432
There are nine realms.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.569
The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.483
I thank you for your sword

12:56.484 --> 12:59.613
and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.092
Hi.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.428
Hi.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.920
So, what's the story with you?

13:25.596 --> 13:27.723
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.058
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date

13:30.059 --> 13:32.027
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.526
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.740
I think there's a story

13:36.899 --> 13:40.073
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.080
It's complicated.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.410
Is he still around?

13:43.614 --> 13:45.537
No, he...

13:46.034 --> 13:47.206
Went away.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.745
I've been there.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.959
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

13:51.247 --> 13:52.464
I was seeing a woman

13:52.749 --> 13:54.422
and she took a job in New York.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.882
Eventually, the distance killed it.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.431
And the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.183
- No!
- Oh, so many.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.346
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?

14:06.512 --> 14:07.559
Sure, I'd love some.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.273
Richard, this is Darcy.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.776
What are you doing here?

14:13.978 --> 14:14.979
Oh. Hello.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.824
So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,

14:18.941 --> 14:22.662
fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas,

14:22.779 --> 14:24.497
eating ice cream and obsessing about...

14:24.655 --> 14:25.822
You know who.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.870
Ah.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.414
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.128
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

14:31.169 --> 14:32.329
Is there a point to all this?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.456
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.674
Right.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.769
You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore?

14:39.295 --> 14:41.263
You might want
to start looking at it again.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.429
This is the reason
we came all the way out here.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.633
It's malfunctioning.

14:44.634 --> 14:45.635
That's what I said.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.678
That's what I did.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.647
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.432
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...

14:52.433 --> 14:53.605
It doesn't look like nothing.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.269
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.362
Our friend Erik

14:57.980 --> 14:59.482
kind of went banana balls.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.649
He's not interested.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.651
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.323
It's time for you to go now.

15:04.695 --> 15:05.787
Okay.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.242
Short but sweet.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.961
She needs help.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.174
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.210
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.

15:20.253 --> 15:24.679
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.310
Sea bass...

15:28.594 --> 15:29.678
Sea bass.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.179
Jane?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.848
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

15:32.849 --> 15:33.896
and go after your friend.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.018
This was so fun.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.942
I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.

15:46.821 --> 15:47.822
And I hate you.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.582
What? I said he was cute.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.784
Just shut up and drive.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.516
You need to take the next left.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.049
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.389
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.511
Hello, Dr. Foster.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.477
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.850
Right. I have to call Erik.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.317
Oh, take a right.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.653
And a left.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.701
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.321
Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you?

16:28.446 --> 16:31.366
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.913
I'm here at Stonehenge

16:33.075 --> 16:36.249
for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.163
<i>The police were called to the scene</i>

16:38.164 --> 16:39.748
<i>shortly after 11 A.M. this morning</i>

16:39.749 --> 16:43.251
<i>after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area</i>

16:43.252 --> 16:46.051
<i>then, decided to strip naked
and effectively</i>

16:46.172 --> 16:48.300
<i>terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment</i>

16:48.591 --> 16:51.310
<i>whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them.</i>

16:51.844 --> 16:55.764
<i>The man, later identified
as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

16:55.765 --> 16:58.393
<i>has been called in
for questioning by police.</i>

17:00.645 --> 17:02.443
Come on, this is exciting.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.732
Look! The intern is excited.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.067
"Ian."

17:06.192 --> 17:07.733
Do you want the phase meter?

17:07.734 --> 17:09.203
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.159
The toaster-looking thing.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.871
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.000
How do I change the ring-tone
on this thing?

17:24.001 --> 17:26.044
An astrophysicist with three degrees

17:26.045 --> 17:27.797
should be able
to change her own ring-tone.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.464
Why are you calling me?

17:29.465 --> 17:31.800
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.849
- "Ian." My name is Ian.
- Shh.

17:47.358 --> 17:51.033
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.737
It's okay, we're Americans.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.781
Is that supposed to make them like us?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.534
- They'll make it go away.
- Shh.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.462
Oh, they're kids.

18:00.788 --> 18:01.914
Are you the police?

18:02.540 --> 18:05.259
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.635
Thanks.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.425
We just found it.

18:10.631 --> 18:11.848
Can you show us?

18:38.326 --> 18:40.829
That doesn't seem right.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.892
Where'd it go?

19:12.443 --> 19:13.444
That's...

19:14.028 --> 19:15.120
That's incredible!

19:28.834 --> 19:30.256
What happened?

19:30.419 --> 19:31.796
Sometimes they come back.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.510
Sometimes they don't.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.680
I want to throw something!

19:37.802 --> 19:38.928
Jane, give me your shoe.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.728
I haven't seen readings like this since...

19:44.350 --> 19:45.351
Since...

19:45.476 --> 19:46.477
New Mexico?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.946
Don't touch anything!

19:55.695 --> 19:57.288
Give me your shoe.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.127
Oh.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.811
Were those the car keys?

20:49.165 --> 20:50.667
Whoa. Ah!

20:52.668 --> 20:54.170
Oh!

20:58.507 --> 20:59.508
Darcy!

21:46.722 --> 21:47.723
Oh!

23:00.546 --> 23:02.799
The Aether awakens us.

23:02.965 --> 23:06.435
The Convergence returns.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.823
You're late.

23:23.903 --> 23:27.157
Merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.963
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.665
Perhaps.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.670
How fare the stars?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.502
Still shining.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.463
From here, I can see
nine realms and ten trillion souls.

23:43.339 --> 23:46.092
Do you recall
what I taught you of the Convergence?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.350
Yes.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.846
The alignment of the worlds.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.730
It approaches, doesn't it?

23:51.972 --> 23:55.852
The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.

23:56.894 --> 24:00.114
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.072
But while its effects can be dangerous,

24:04.902 --> 24:07.746
it is truly beautiful.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.573
I see nothing.

24:10.574 --> 24:14.204
Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.385
How is she?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.466
She's quite clever,
your mortal.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.921
She doesn't know it yet,

24:24.922 --> 24:27.425
but she studies
the Convergence as well.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.808
Even...

24:30.552 --> 24:31.974
What?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.229
I can't see her.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.233
Jane!

25:18.809 --> 25:20.106
Where the hell were you?

25:20.436 --> 25:21.936
Tell me you didn't call the police.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.063
What was I supposed to do?

25:23.188 --> 25:25.064
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.357
You call the cops, they call the Feds.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.281
Next thing you know,
we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over

25:28.485 --> 25:30.028
- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.196
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.494
We had unimpeded access.

25:33.824 --> 25:36.122
Our only competition was ten years old!

25:36.285 --> 25:37.832
Jane! You were gone for five hours.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.622
What?

25:46.462 --> 25:48.135
That's weird.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.115
Typical.

26:11.862 --> 26:12.909
Jane.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.327
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.

26:18.494 --> 26:19.996
It's been a very strange day.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.664
I am. Jane, what...

26:22.081 --> 26:23.128
Where were you?

26:23.332 --> 26:24.333
Where were you?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.593
Heimdall cannot see you.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.504
I was right here where you left me.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.848
I was waiting, and then I was crying

26:30.964 --> 26:32.511
and then I went out looking for you.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.221
You said you were coming back.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.728
I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.434
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.728
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.893
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

26:44.478 --> 26:48.314
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

26:48.315 --> 26:51.159
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

26:52.069 --> 26:54.862
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

26:54.863 --> 26:56.661
but I was wrong.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.701
I was a fool.

26:59.576 --> 27:03.046
But I believe
that fate brought us together.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.173
Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...

27:09.002 --> 27:10.003
What?

27:11.255 --> 27:12.302
I know...

27:13.507 --> 27:14.633
You do?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.227
Do what?

27:17.845 --> 27:18.971
What?

27:19.555 --> 27:20.556
Hey!

27:22.307 --> 27:23.775
Is this you?

27:27.997 --> 27:29.981
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something here.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.656
Um, I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.

27:32.901 --> 27:33.902
Hold that thought.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.990
Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.741
How's space?

27:40.742 --> 27:42.870
Space is fine.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.247
Excuse me.

27:44.413 --> 27:45.580
- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.582
Do you know this man?

27:48.125 --> 27:49.251
He's my intern.

27:50.419 --> 27:51.591
My intern's intern.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.796
This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.094
You'll have to come with me.

28:00.888 --> 28:01.889
Jane.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.649
- Jane.
- Thor?

28:04.975 --> 28:05.976
Are you all right?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.357
What just happened?

28:07.936 --> 28:10.521
Place your hands
on your heads. Step back.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.647
This woman is unwell.

28:11.648 --> 28:12.649
She's dangerous.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.993
So am I.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.114
Requesting armed response officers
to scene.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.115
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

28:28.457 --> 28:30.505
Holy shit.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.034
We have to do that again.

29:00.489 --> 29:01.490
Hi.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.499
Welcome to Asgard.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.527
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.732
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.656
Our survival will be your legacy.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.365
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.700
I will reclaim the Aether.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.034
I will restore our world.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.754
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.130
What's that?

29:59.131 --> 30:00.178
Be still.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.101
This is not of Earth. What is it?

30:10.892 --> 30:12.565
We do not know.

30:13.270 --> 30:17.241
But she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.459
That's a quantum field generator,
isn't it?

30:25.073 --> 30:26.916
It's a soul forge.

30:27.034 --> 30:30.254
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

30:33.123 --> 30:34.170
Yes.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.043
Quantum field generator.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.093
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

30:40.255 --> 30:41.381
She is ill.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.759
She is mortal.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.472
Illness is their defining trait.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.303
I brought her here
because we can help her.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.227
She does not belong here in Asgard

30:49.389 --> 30:52.768
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.602
Did he just...

30:54.603 --> 30:56.270
Who do you think you are?

30:56.271 --> 30:58.820
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.529
Protector of the Nine Realms.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.278
Oh. Well, I'm...

31:03.445 --> 31:06.289
I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.617
You told your dad about me?

31:09.493 --> 31:10.961
Something is within her, Father.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.411
Something I have not seen before.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.629
Her world has its healers.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.667
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.589
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.544
No, I would not...

31:22.297 --> 31:23.389
...touch her.

31:23.507 --> 31:24.804
Jane, are you all right?

31:25.342 --> 31:26.468
Yeah.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.432
It's impossible.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.394
The infection... It's defending her.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.316
No.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.486
It's defending itself.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.526
Come with me.

31:42.651 --> 31:46.451
There are relics
that pre-date the universe itself.

31:46.613 --> 31:50.493
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.996
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.334
They had a dawn

31:55.497 --> 31:56.669
as they will have a dusk.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.000
But before that dawn

31:59.167 --> 32:05.516
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

32:07.467 --> 32:08.764
"Born of eternal night

32:08.885 --> 32:11.729
the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."

32:12.180 --> 32:15.683
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.

32:15.684 --> 32:19.019
Their leader Malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness

32:19.020 --> 32:20.688
and it was called the Aether.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.816
While the other relics
often appear as stones

32:23.817 --> 32:26.491
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.247
It changes matter into dark matter.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.959
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.

32:34.202 --> 32:37.172
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

32:37.330 --> 32:41.085
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.462
But, after eternities of bloodshed

32:44.463 --> 32:47.057
my father Bor finally triumphed

32:47.215 --> 32:51.721
ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.

32:52.721 --> 32:53.893
What happened?

32:55.182 --> 32:57.105
He killed them all.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.477
Are you certain?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.562
The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

33:01.563 --> 33:02.815
and yet here it is.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.405
The Dark Elves are dead.

33:07.068 --> 33:10.613
Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?

33:10.614 --> 33:11.615
No.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.243
It does not.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.964
The worlds are nearly aligned.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.137
You will be the last of the Kursed.

33:35.305 --> 33:36.932
Let my life be sacrificed.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.610
It is no less than our people did.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.441
Or you have done.

33:50.237 --> 33:52.205
You will become darkness.

33:53.406 --> 33:57.127
Cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

34:02.374 --> 34:06.254
Until then. no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

34:09.339 --> 34:16.143
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

34:38.368 --> 34:41.371
Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.706
Oh, please!
If they were beneath you,

34:43.706 --> 34:45.835
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.517
- Keep in line!
- Move it!

35:04.019 --> 35:07.694
Odin continues to
bring me new friends.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.816
How thoughtful.

35:10.066 --> 35:13.536
The books I sent,
do they not interest you?

35:14.029 --> 35:17.406
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?

35:17.407 --> 35:20.618
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.666
Have you?

35:22.704 --> 35:24.547
Does Odin share your concern?

35:25.999 --> 35:27.546
Does Thor?

35:27.709 --> 35:31.420
It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.

35:31.421 --> 35:34.550
You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.434
My actions?

35:36.593 --> 35:39.928
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...

35:39.929 --> 35:41.680
That I was born to be a king.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.724
A king?

35:43.725 --> 35:45.727
A true king admits his faults.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.292
What of the lives you took on Earth?

35:47.437 --> 35:49.104
A mere handful
compared to the number

35:49.105 --> 35:50.903
that Odin has taken himself.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.740
- Your father...
- He's not my father!

35:56.613 --> 35:58.832
Then am I not your mother?

36:04.037 --> 36:06.005
You're not.

36:09.793 --> 36:14.765
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

36:29.938 --> 36:33.112
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.485
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.282
You were no longer on Earth.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.741
How is that possible?

36:37.946 --> 36:39.988
I believe you were and you weren't.

36:39.989 --> 36:42.868
The Nine Realms
travel within Yggdrasil

36:43.159 --> 36:46.413
orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

36:46.579 --> 36:50.791
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly

36:50.792 --> 36:53.011
and we call this the Convergence.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.805
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.266
It's possible
you found one of these points.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.524
We are lucky that it remained open.

37:06.683 --> 37:10.938
Once the worlds pass out of alignment

37:12.355 --> 37:14.403
then the connection is lost.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.540
I like the way you explain things.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.210
What's going to happen to me?

37:33.376 --> 37:34.969
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

37:35.128 --> 37:38.302
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.179
Don't let him hear you say that.

37:41.551 --> 37:42.926
Jane Foster...

37:42.927 --> 37:44.344
Please meet Frigga,

37:44.345 --> 37:46.268
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.485
Hi.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.031
Move!

39:27.615 --> 39:28.867
To the dungeons!

39:29.242 --> 39:30.243
Come on!

39:54.058 --> 39:56.481
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.873
The prisons.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.830
- Loki...
- Go.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.835
I will look after her.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.856
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!

40:29.844 --> 40:32.688
There's no pleasing some creatures.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.849
Return to your cells,
no further harm will come to you.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.196
You have my word.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.371
Very well, you do not have my word.

40:58.247 --> 41:00.249
Send a squadron
to the weapons vault.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.924
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.679
- Odin.
- Frigga.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.547
Go!

41:07.340 --> 41:08.592
It's a skirmish.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.967
Nothing to fear.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.470
You've never been a very good liar.

41:12.249 --> 41:13.553
Take her to your chambers.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.431
I'll come for you when it's safe.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.140
You take care.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.262
Despite all I have survived,

41:19.060 --> 41:21.779
my queen still worries over me.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.106
It's only because I worry over you

41:23.231 --> 41:25.074
that you have survived.

41:27.568 --> 41:28.785
Listen to me now.

41:28.945 --> 41:31.915
I need you to do everything I ask,
no questions.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.203
Yes, ma'am.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.412
Oh!

45:45.785 --> 45:47.162
- Ow!
- Ah!

46:42.758 --> 46:45.887
The throne of Asgard
is destroyed! To the king!

47:01.694 --> 47:02.695
Frigga

47:11.495 --> 47:13.918
Stand down, creature,

47:14.081 --> 47:15.790
and you may still survive this.

47:15.791 --> 47:17.885
I have survived worse, woman.

47:19.337 --> 47:20.714
Who are you?

47:21.255 --> 47:23.303
I am Malekith.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.094
And I would have what is mine.

47:38.356 --> 47:39.357
Ah!

47:56.749 --> 47:58.922
You have taken something, child.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.007
Give it back.

48:15.393 --> 48:16.485
Witch!

48:20.189 --> 48:21.691
Where is the Aether?

48:21.816 --> 48:24.114
I'll never tell you.

48:25.111 --> 48:26.328
I believe you.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.996
No!

51:57.740 --> 51:59.913
<i>The universe rotates
on a 5,000 year cycle</i>

52:00.784 --> 52:03.162
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.

52:03.829 --> 52:06.753
Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.

52:07.499 --> 52:09.547
Oh, thank you. And this is another world.

52:09.710 --> 52:11.678
Normally, they're separate.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.630
But during the Alignment,

52:13.631 --> 52:17.181
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

52:17.343 --> 52:19.594
All nine realms
are passing through each other

52:19.595 --> 52:21.939
and gravity, light, and even matter,

52:22.222 --> 52:24.645
is crashing from one world to the other.

52:26.977 --> 52:30.980
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

52:30.981 --> 52:35.487
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.

52:36.195 --> 52:38.571
This time, the Alignment

52:38.572 --> 52:41.576
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

52:41.742 --> 52:43.244
It's beautiful.

52:44.745 --> 52:46.918
It's simple. Any questions?

52:50.042 --> 52:51.089
Yeah.

52:51.543 --> 52:54.262
Can I have my shoe back?

53:02.012 --> 53:06.017
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.

53:06.517 --> 53:10.112
And when you wake,
we will kill them all.

53:45.681 --> 53:46.978
Jane Foster?

53:48.642 --> 53:50.815
You need to come with us.

53:52.062 --> 53:55.157
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

53:55.274 --> 53:56.696
Our artillery cannot detect them.

53:56.817 --> 53:58.615
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

54:01.989 --> 54:05.914
My king, we are all but defenseless.

54:08.495 --> 54:09.963
She's your prisoner now?

54:12.332 --> 54:13.675
Leave us.

54:22.676 --> 54:24.849
I do not wish to fight with you.

54:25.345 --> 54:27.180
Nor I with you.

54:27.181 --> 54:29.024
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

54:29.183 --> 54:30.480
We possess the Aether.

54:31.143 --> 54:32.360
Malekith will come to us.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.604
Yes, and he will destroy us.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.733
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

54:36.857 --> 54:39.201
No, I value our people's lives.

54:39.359 --> 54:42.659
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

54:43.405 --> 54:45.698
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,

54:45.699 --> 54:47.701
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

54:47.868 --> 54:49.666
And I will destroy it and him.

54:51.705 --> 54:54.540
If you fail, you risk this weapon

54:54.541 --> 54:56.384
falling into the hands of our enemies.

54:56.502 --> 54:58.880
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

54:59.004 --> 55:00.972
His ship could be over our heads
right now,

55:01.173 --> 55:02.390
we would never even know it.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.800
If and when he comes

55:03.801 --> 55:08.054
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

55:08.055 --> 55:09.477
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

55:09.598 --> 55:11.566
As many as are needed!

55:14.645 --> 55:15.737
Ah!

55:20.526 --> 55:22.073
We will fight!

55:24.571 --> 55:27.120
Till the last Asgardian breath.

55:27.908 --> 55:30.957
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

55:33.080 --> 55:36.209
Then how are you different
from Malekith?

55:39.419 --> 55:42.013
The difference, my son, is that I will win.

55:56.311 --> 55:59.110
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

55:59.231 --> 56:01.154
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

56:01.275 --> 56:03.192
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.116
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

56:05.237 --> 56:08.036
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

56:08.282 --> 56:11.826
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.828
<i>Something else
went missing this week</i>

56:13.829 --> 56:16.958
<i>when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

56:17.082 --> 56:20.632
<i>notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York</i>

56:20.794 --> 56:22.091
<i>streaked nude across...</i>

56:22.254 --> 56:24.803
Darcy,
you really need to look at this.

56:24.965 --> 56:26.215
Your friend, Erik...

56:26.216 --> 56:27.968
What was his last name again?

56:28.927 --> 56:32.306
<i>And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.</i>

56:32.472 --> 56:34.520
<i>He was later taken into police custody</i>

56:35.142 --> 56:37.440
<i>for psychiatric evaluation.</i>

56:37.603 --> 56:39.651
<i>Police are still refusing to confirm...</i>

56:50.157 --> 56:52.205
You were not at Odin's war council.

56:52.326 --> 56:54.670
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.245
No one is to come

56:56.246 --> 56:57.543
or to go.

56:59.625 --> 57:02.344
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

57:02.502 --> 57:06.223
What use is a guardian such as that?

57:07.674 --> 57:10.427
Malekith will return, you know this.

57:12.971 --> 57:14.018
I need your help.

57:14.640 --> 57:18.235
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

57:18.352 --> 57:19.979
I'm not asking you to.

57:20.187 --> 57:22.531
The realms need their Allfather strong
and unchallenged

57:22.689 --> 57:25.238
whether he is or not.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.193
But he is blinded, Heimdall

57:27.194 --> 57:29.028
by hatred and by grief.

57:29.029 --> 57:30.780
As are we all.

57:30.781 --> 57:32.073
I see clearly enough.

57:32.074 --> 57:33.701
The risks are too great.

57:33.992 --> 57:36.711
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

57:36.870 --> 57:38.588
There is no other way.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.761
What do you require of me?

57:44.878 --> 57:48.428
<i>What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.</i>

57:48.715 --> 57:52.765
<i>Success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death.</i>

57:55.639 --> 57:59.735
<i>Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.</i>

58:00.268 --> 58:02.441
<i>If we do nothing,
he will come for it again</i>

58:02.604 --> 58:06.734
<i>but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.</i>

58:07.734 --> 58:09.736
We must move Jane off-world.

58:09.903 --> 58:11.576
The Bifrost has been shut down

58:11.697 --> 58:13.415
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

58:13.573 --> 58:17.785
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

58:17.786 --> 58:19.709
One, actually.

58:21.790 --> 58:23.542
No.

58:27.921 --> 58:31.257
Thor. After all this time

58:31.258 --> 58:33.932
and now you come to visit me.

58:35.137 --> 58:36.434
Why?

58:37.764 --> 58:40.813
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

58:40.934 --> 58:42.561
Loki, enough.

58:42.978 --> 58:44.821
No more illusions.

58:51.987 --> 58:54.081
Now you see me, brother.

59:02.789 --> 59:04.507
Did she suffer?

59:04.624 --> 59:06.968
I did not come here to share our grief.

59:07.085 --> 59:10.180
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

59:11.590 --> 59:12.807
Go on.

59:12.966 --> 59:15.718
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

59:15.719 --> 59:18.689
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

59:18.972 --> 59:20.349
Vengeance

59:20.515 --> 59:22.938
and afterward, this cell.

59:29.691 --> 59:34.492
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

59:36.156 --> 59:37.823
What makes you think
you can trust me?

59:37.824 --> 59:39.246
I don't

59:40.952 --> 59:42.044
Mother did.

59:43.330 --> 59:45.833
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

59:46.666 --> 59:48.209
I did so with a glimmer of hope

59:48.210 --> 59:50.087
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.

59:51.713 --> 59:54.182
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

59:55.008 --> 59:58.387
You betray me, and I will kill you.

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.399
Hmm.

01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:05.684
When do we start?

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.103
He will betray you.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.731
He will try.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:15.696
This is so unlike you, brother.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.864
So clandestine.

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:20.230
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.869
If you keep speaking, I just might.

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:24.837
Fine. As you wish.

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.377
I'm not even here.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:29.209
Is this better?

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.879
It's better company at least.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:35.928
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.853
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:44.396
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:47.732
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.942
given that you seem
to like them so much.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.606
Oh, this is much better.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:53.608
Ooh.

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:56.570
The costume is a bit much. So tight.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:58.033
But the confidence...

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:00.619
I can feel the righteousness surging.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:03.251
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:04.994
Honor? Patriotism?

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:05.996
God bless Amer...

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:10.050
What?

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:16.924
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.967
My dagger, something.

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:25.806
At last.

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:27.525
A little common sense.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:36.275
And I thought you liked tricks.

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:40.827
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:42.823
who will see you coming
from miles away.

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:44.542
I won't be the one who comes for her.

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:53.335
I'm not hungry.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.961
What the...

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:58.215
Good. Let's go.

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:04.642
You're...

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.847
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:09.475
That was for New York.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:10.853
I like her.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:12.650
<i>And what of the Allfather?</i>

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:17.034
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.780
You called me here on an urgent matter.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:22.822
What is it?

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:24.657
Treason, my lord.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.001
Whose?

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:27.748
Mine.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.079
My king!

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.082
The mortal has been taken.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.044
Stop Thor.

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:39.173
By any means necessary.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:44.386
There they are! Take them.

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:45.552
On my command.

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:47.772
I'll hold them off. Take her.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.812
Thank you.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.853
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.617
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:09.544
Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.245
what good would it do?

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:14.206
We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:17.427
That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.382
I will give you as much time as I can.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.226
Thank you, my friend.

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:32.563
If you even think about betraying him...

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.393
You'll kill me?

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:36.396
Evidently, there will be a line.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.797
I thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.831
I said, "How hard could it be?"

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:00.128
They're on the ship!

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:02.259
Get to the ship!

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.635
Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:11.014
Shut up, Loki.

01:04:12.126 --> 01:04:13.390
You must have missed something.

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:16.185
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.779
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:19.739
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.860
Ha, ha!

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.082
Get him! Get him!

01:04:57.644 --> 01:05:00.147
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:08.737
Look,
why don't you let me take over?

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:09.990
I'm clearly the better pilot.

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:12.204
Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:13.827
which one can actually fly?

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.004
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.006
Jane.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:28.800
I'm okay.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.932
Ah!

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.275
Not a word.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:40.771
Now they're following us.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.277
Now they're firing at us.

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:48.861
Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.205
it's not at all distracting!

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:57.370
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.141
You know, this is wonderful.

01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:12.556
This is a tremendous idea.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:15.814
Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.306
and escape in that.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:18.557
Flying around the city,

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.936
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.780
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:38.994
I see your time in the dungeons

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.589
has made you no less graceful, Loki.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:47.761
You lied to me.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.464
I'm impressed.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:52.007
I'm glad you're pleased.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.091
Now, do as you promised.

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.935
And take us to your secret pathway.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:19.706
- Fandral.
- Right.

01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:24.415
For Asgard.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.138
Nothing personal, boys.

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:47.896
Loki...

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:51.316
If it were easy, everyone would do it.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.319
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.511
Ta-da!

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.395
We must strike now.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.430
No.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:28.689
Asgard is meaningless.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.823
The Aether has found its way home.

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:54.171
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.845
It would consume you.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.393
She's holding up all right.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:01.345
For now.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:04.437
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:05.974
Say goodbye.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.773
Not this day.

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:10.693
This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.486
It's a heartbeat.

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.902
You'll never be ready.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:17.903
The only woman
whose love you've prized

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.779
will be snatched from you.

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:21.078
And will that satisfy you?

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:22.823
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:25.044
Surrender is not in mine.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.412
- The son of Odin...
- No.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.461
Not just of Odin.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.926
You think you alone
were loved of Mother?

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.087
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:35.509
Trust?

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:37.924
Was that her last expression?

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.768
Trust? When you let her die?

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:43.679
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.102
Who put me there?

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:46.224
You know damn well!

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.685
You know damn well who!

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:57.615
She wouldn't want us to fight.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.285
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:08.496
I wish I could trust you.

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:24.978
Trust my rage.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.523
You'll have to sign
for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:36.361
What?

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:37.899
Oh, yeah.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.904
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:45.073
One man's leather wallet, brown.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.543
One key ring, three keys.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.583
Prescription medicine...

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.581
Various.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.002
- And...
- Erik.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.087
- These.
- Yeah.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.305
Those.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.095
Thank goodness.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.977
Erik.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:07.889
Yes?

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.687
It's, uh, Darcy.

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:10.899
Darcy.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.900
So good to see you.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:16.068
Oh, I missed you, too.

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:17.689
How did you find me?

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:18.942
You were naked on TV.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:22.446
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.532
Getting weird now.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.078
I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:34.122
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:37.127
I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.466
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:41.806
Are you all right?

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.807
I've had a god in my brain.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.602
I don't recommend it.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:50.597
Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:52.976
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.769
Wait. What's happening?

01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.737
Birds?

01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:01.316
Birds are happening?

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.570
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.909
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:07.574
- Nerd.
- Look!

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.334
Where did they go?

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:29.432
What the hell was that?

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:31.602
Why are you smiling?

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.056
There's nothing more reassuring

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:36.852
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.732
Take me to Jane's lab.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.669
Jane.

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:01.636
Malekith.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.823
All right. Are you ready?

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.237
I am.

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.001
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.879
Yes, possibly.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:49.868
You still don't trust me, brother?

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:52.641
Would you?

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:02.779
No, I wouldn't.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.036
Thor!

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:11.455
No!

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:23.291
You really think I cared about Frigga?

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.010
About any of you?

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.006
All I ever wanted

01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:31.555
was you and Odin

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:32.768
dead at my feet!

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:46.399
Malekith!

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.486
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:52.576
and I bring you a gift.

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:56.449
I ask only one thing in return...

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.326
A good seat from which

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.327
to watch Asgard burn.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.831
He is an enemy of Asgard.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:05.585
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:20.933
Look at me.

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.451
Loki! Now!

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:42.082
Ah!

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:37.296
Ah!

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.906
- Ah!
- No!

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:48.284
See you in hell, monster.

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:08.604
No. No, no, no.

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:13.266
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:14.268
I know...

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.562
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:18.813
Stay with me, okay?

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:19.986
I'm sorry.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:24.245
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shh...

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:25.658
It's okay.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:30.785
It's all right.

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:34.413
I'll tell Father what you did here today.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.423
I didn't do it for him.

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:51.347
No!

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.198
He's going to unleash it.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:52.496
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:53.742
How?

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:55.999
Jane, how?

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.340
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.292
The Convergence.

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:02.708
Oh, God.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:05.149
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:07.673
Then Malekith
would've only possessed it

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:09.549
that much sooner.

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:12.019
I only found it
because I was looking for you.

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:13.888
Jane...

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:17.232
Now we're trapped here.

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:24.989
It's not me.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.492
Hello?

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.826
<i>Hi, Jane, it's Richard.</i>

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:30.738
Richard? Where are you?

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:32.080
I'm still at the office.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:34.240
It's been a crazy day here today.

01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:36.164
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
<i>- Is it?</i>

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:37.577
<i>I quite enjoyed our lunch</i>

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.745
despite never actually
ordering anything.

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:41.247
How am I getting service here?

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:43.376
<i>Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?</i>

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.674
No, no, no. Please, whatever
you do, do not hang up the phone.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:48.754
Okay, then.

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:51.215
<i>I was just wondering
if you want to try again.</i>

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:52.758
<i>Uh, maybe dinner next time.</i>

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:54.386
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.764
<i>- Just stay on the phone, okay?</i>
- Yeah, I will.

01:22:56.889 --> 01:22:58.857
Oh, my God.

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:03.895
Am I interrupting something?

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:05.614
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

01:23:05.772 --> 01:23:06.856
Come on.

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:07.949
<i>I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?</i>

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:09.609
Where are we going?

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.611
<i>Hello?</i>

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:12.579
Why are there so many shoes in here?

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:15.999
I'll just text her.

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:29.467
So, who's Richard?

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.098
Really?

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:40.973
- Jane!
- Hey.

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:42.808
You can't just leave like that.

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:44.106
The whole world is going crazy.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:46.112
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:49.449
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:53.241
Jane! How wonderful.

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.159
Oh!

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.406
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?

01:23:57.407 --> 01:23:59.159
Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:00.952
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

01:24:00.953 --> 01:24:03.672
All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:05.039
Okay.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.134
Are you well, Erik?

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:09.086
Your brother's not coming, is he?

01:24:10.087 --> 01:24:11.504
Loki is dead.

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:12.597
Oh, thank God!

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:15.976
I... I meant, I'm so sorry.

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:17.640
Thank you.

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.120
Forgive me, my liege.

01:24:43.954 --> 01:24:46.457
I've returned from
the Dark World with news.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.009
Thor?

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:55.095
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:58.142
What?

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.723
We found a body.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.562
Loki.

01:25:12.586 --> 01:25:14.650
Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot

01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:16.574
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:19.238
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:20.661
For each additional world,

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.876
the power will increase exponentially.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.039
The effect would be universal.

01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:27.872
But the Alignment is only temporary.

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:30.922
He must be in
exactly the right place at the right time.

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:32.716
Well, how do we know where that is?

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.343
We follow the directions.

01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:37.758
This has happened before

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:41.228
thousands of years ago,
and the Ancients were there to see it.

01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:43.264
All the great constructions,

01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:46.891
the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:50.394
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:52.563
And they left us a map.

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:53.986
Stonehenge,

01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:56.567
Snowdon,

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:57.818
the Great Orme.

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.696
These are all coordinates taking us...

01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:02.074
Here.

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:06.118
Greenwich?

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:08.747
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:10.289
Physics is going to go ballistic.

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.133
Increases and decreases in gravity,

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:13.793
spatial extrusions.

01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:16.422
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:21.928
I better get my pants.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:24.855
Focus! This is important.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.481
We have to hammer them in
all around the site

01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:28.896
and then Jane and Erik
will activate them from the tower.

01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:30.694
They're taped together.

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:33.192
Do you even know
what these things do?

01:26:33.563 --> 01:26:35.190
Uh... No.

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:36.525
Neither do I.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:42.622
Shh!

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:47.327
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.133
Holy...

01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:02.259
Shit.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:15.772
Ah!

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:23.094
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:25.434
Death would've come to you
soon enough.

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.134
Not by your hand.

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:29.970
Your universe was never meant to be.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:33.140
Your world and your family

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.269
will be extinguished!

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:38.901
We're running out of time.

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:41.440
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:44.035
These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.

01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:46.162
Oh, come on.

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:53.537
Come on, Darcy.

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:05.932
You know, with all that power,

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.551
I thought you'd hit harder.

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:34.043
Done.

01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:43.678
The Convergence
will be in full effect in seven minutes.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:45.996
That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.347
Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.478
That is awesome!

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:03.063
<i>How did you do that?</i>

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.440
Well, the gravitational fields

01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:06.817
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.240
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:13.533
- Oops.
- Let's go.

01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:15.080
Um...

01:30:15.264 --> 01:30:17.328
What the hell just happened?

01:30:17.329 --> 01:30:18.956
Move!

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:38.062
What are you all doing?

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:39.856
You need to get out of here, now!

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:41.523
You're joking, right?

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:42.686
That's Thor out there.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.815
He's waving his hammer around
and everything!

01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:45.125
Ah!

01:32:02.987 --> 01:32:04.852
<i>Confirming ship is hostile.</i>

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:06.812
<i>Confirmed, ship is hostile.</i>

01:32:06.813 --> 01:32:08.313
<i>You have permission to engage.</i>

01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:09.606
<i>Roger.</i>

01:32:09.607 --> 01:32:10.733
<i>Missiles locked.</i>

01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:13.320
<i>Missiles away.</i>

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:16.030
<i>Missiles off target.</i>

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:18.824
<i>I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.</i>

01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:21.624
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.</i>

01:32:23.747 --> 01:32:24.830
What are you doing?

01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:26.333
My signal's not connecting.

01:32:28.626 --> 01:32:29.710
Jane!

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:30.803
Come on.

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.385
Are you all right?

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:15.548
You saved my life.

01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:20.260
Yeah.

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:21.558
I guess I did.

01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:30.355
Mmm.

01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:31.731
Darcy?

01:33:32.065 --> 01:33:33.148
Jane!

01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:35.493
- Ian!
- Selvig!

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:37.199
Mew mew!

01:33:40.824 --> 01:33:42.701
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:45.993
How do I get to Greenwich?

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:49.040
Take this train. Three stops.

01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:53.629
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:57.515
Sorry. Sorry.

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:36.676
- We're out of time.
- Jane.

01:34:37.797 --> 01:34:38.923
Jane!

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:06.288
Thor!

01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:08.332
We're too late.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:11.798
The Convergence is at its peak.

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:13.791
Can those things stop him?

01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:15.009
Not from here.

01:35:15.168 --> 01:35:17.967
We can't get close enough.

01:35:19.005 --> 01:35:20.257
I can.

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:46.574
Malekith!

01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:57.211
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

01:35:57.335 --> 01:36:00.712
Have you come
to witness the end of your universe?

01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:02.761
I've come to accept your surrender.

01:36:22.318 --> 01:36:24.412
You think you can stop this?

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:27.912
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

01:36:28.032 --> 01:36:29.705
But you can.

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:17.248
Thor! No.

01:37:27.592 --> 01:37:28.639
Jane!

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.199
Ah!

01:37:59.332 --> 01:38:00.925
Everybody okay?

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:47.426
He's gonna come back.

01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:51.801
Except, you know,

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:54.177
last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

01:38:54.178 --> 01:38:56.101
Well, it's only been two days, so...

01:38:58.015 --> 01:38:59.858
Did he say anything before he left?

01:38:59.976 --> 01:39:02.227
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.

01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:06.358
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:12.242
Oh.

01:39:14.866 --> 01:39:19.542
<i>You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.</i>

01:39:19.704 --> 01:39:20.705
<i>You were wrong.</i>

01:39:21.289 --> 01:39:25.250
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

01:39:25.251 --> 01:39:28.380
Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.

01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:33.472
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.512
My life.

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:40.432
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.

01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:45.234
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:47.607
but I cannot do so from that chair.

01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:51.862
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

01:39:52.862 --> 01:39:55.536
The brutality, the sacrifice...

01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:57.240
It changes you.

01:39:57.241 --> 01:40:00.666
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

01:40:01.245 --> 01:40:06.124
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

01:40:06.125 --> 01:40:08.674
When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:13.298
This is not for Jane, Father.

01:40:13.299 --> 01:40:15.800
She does not know
what I came here to say.

01:40:15.801 --> 01:40:19.146
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.

01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:20.606
It changes nothing.

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:24.527
One son
who wanted the throne too much,

01:40:25.436 --> 01:40:27.564
another who will not take it.

01:40:28.105 --> 01:40:29.857
Is this my legacy?

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:31.617
Loki died with honor.

01:40:32.568 --> 01:40:34.027
I shall try to live the same.

01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:35.450
Is that not legacy enough?

01:40:46.457 --> 01:40:48.801
It belongs to you.

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:51.378
If you are worthy of it.

01:40:51.379 --> 01:40:53.882
I shall try to be.

01:40:55.299 --> 01:41:00.021
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:02.645
I know.

01:41:05.476 --> 01:41:08.821
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:11.657
even that, I could not say.

01:41:14.151 --> 01:41:17.781
It would speak only from my heart.

01:41:19.156 --> 01:41:20.578
Go,

01:41:21.659 --> 01:41:23.161
my son.

01:41:25.288 --> 01:41:26.540
Thank you, Father.

01:41:42.138 --> 01:41:43.185
No.

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:46.188
Thank you.

01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:06.619
I present to you,

01:44:07.324 --> 01:44:10.828
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:13.501
Whoa...

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:21.135
Asgardians, it's an honor.

01:44:24.842 --> 01:44:26.936
You know why we're here.

01:44:30.639 --> 01:44:32.562
Of course.

01:44:33.392 --> 01:44:35.645
But, if I may ask,

01:44:35.811 --> 01:44:39.691
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

01:44:39.815 --> 01:44:42.739
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:46.410
It is not wise to keep
two Infinity Stones so close together.

01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:49.534
That's very wise.

01:44:59.376 --> 01:45:00.753
I can assure you,

01:45:02.004 --> 01:45:07.226
it will be absolutely safe here,

01:45:09.428 --> 01:45:11.931
in my collection.

01:45:13.098 --> 01:45:15.521
See that it is.

01:45:34.078 --> 01:45:36.581
One down.

01:45:38.082 --> 01:45:40.585
Five to go.
