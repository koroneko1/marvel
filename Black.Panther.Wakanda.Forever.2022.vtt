WEBVTT

00:04.839 --> 00:05.919
Shuri: Bast...

00:06.799 --> 00:08.718
Time is running out.

00:09.886 --> 00:12.388
Please allow me to heal
my brother of this illness,

00:13.055 --> 00:15.600
and I will never
question your existence again.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.442
His heart rate is dropping
fast. Where are we?

00:18.477 --> 00:19.812
We are finishing a sequence now.

00:19.896 --> 00:21.439
Shuri: Griot,
give me the controls.

00:21.606 --> 00:22.899
Griot: As you wish, Princess.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.072
What is the confidence rate?

00:30.656 --> 00:31.824
Griot: 25%.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.951
We'll have to try another way.

00:34.577 --> 00:35.846
Griot:
King t'challa's heart rate

00:35.870 --> 00:38.080
has fallen to 31 beats
per minute.

00:38.164 --> 00:40.791
Princess,
you should go be by his side.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.294
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.713
Get out!

00:51.928 --> 00:53.095
What is the confidence rate?

00:53.179 --> 00:54.597
Griot: 29.1%.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.723
Print it!

01:00.436 --> 01:02.563
Griot: Princess,
I am aware of the urgency,

01:02.647 --> 01:04.272
but I must warn you,

01:04.357 --> 01:06.234
this synthetic heart-shaped herb

01:06.317 --> 01:08.778
has a minimal chance of
producing the desired effects.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.864
I don't care! Has to work.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.176
Griot.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.302
Griot: Yes, Princess?

01:34.178 --> 01:35.721
What's my brother's heart rate?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.103
Your brother

01:43.187 --> 01:45.690
is with the ancestors.

01:52.697 --> 01:54.031
No.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.401
All: Praise the ancestors.

02:51.172 --> 02:55.468
Dancers:
T'challa, t'challa, t'challa

02:55.551 --> 03:00.431
t'challa, t'challa, t'challa

03:00.514 --> 03:04.769
t'challa, t'challa, t'challa

03:05.936 --> 03:09.648
t'challa, t'challa, t'challa

03:11.067 --> 03:13.944
t'challa, t'challa, t'challa

03:16.405 --> 03:20.159
T'challa, t'challa, t'challa

03:21.660 --> 03:22.787
t'challa

04:50.207 --> 04:52.084
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.147
Chairperson: It is an honor for me...

06:37.231 --> 06:39.900
To invite her majesty,
queen ramonda,

06:39.984 --> 06:41.402
daughter of lumumba,

06:41.485 --> 06:43.445
sovereign ruler
of the kingdom of wakanda.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.627
Us secretary of state:
Mr. Chairperson,

06:59.628 --> 07:04.216
I believe I speak for
all the member states here

07:04.300 --> 07:07.094
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed

07:07.177 --> 07:09.263
in wakanda's failure

07:09.346 --> 07:13.809
to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts

07:13.892 --> 07:15.978
to tackle
international challenges,

07:16.061 --> 07:17.563
to share resources,

07:17.646 --> 07:19.857
and full cooperation

07:19.940 --> 07:21.400
concerning vibranium.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.711
I now give the floor

07:40.794 --> 07:42.713
to her majesty, queen ramonda.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.681
It has always been our policy

07:52.765 --> 07:57.770
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

07:57.853 --> 08:02.149
Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,

08:03.025 --> 08:07.821
but because of the dangerous
potential of you.

08:48.237 --> 08:52.116
You perform civility here.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.202
But we know what you whisper

08:55.828 --> 08:57.579
in your halls of leadership

08:57.663 --> 09:00.541
and in your military facilities.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.673
"The king is dead.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.428
"The black panther is gone.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.599
"They have lost their protector.

09:23.522 --> 09:26.734
Ramonda: "Now is our time...

09:28.235 --> 09:29.361
"To strike."

09:56.555 --> 09:58.432
Aneka, where is your spear?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.017
Shuri gave me these to try.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.646
You know, I like them better.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.410
Okoye: Our foremothers
gave us the spear...

10:06.482 --> 10:09.151
Because it is precise,
elegant...

10:10.819 --> 10:11.862
And deadly.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.159
It will not change
under my watch.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.537
Yes, general.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.956
I told you not to bring them.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.961
Last night
there was another attack

10:28.045 --> 10:30.547
on one of
our outreach facilities.

10:31.465 --> 10:35.302
Proof of the involvement
of a member state

10:35.385 --> 10:39.389
is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.393
And as for the identity
of the attackers...

11:03.163 --> 11:06.625
Let our gracious
response to this incursion

11:07.626 --> 11:09.127
be an olive branch.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.091
Further attempts
on our resources

11:14.174 --> 11:17.469
will be considered
an act of aggression

11:17.553 --> 11:21.181
and met with
a much steeper response.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.352
We mourn the loss of our king.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.772
But do not think for a second

11:28.856 --> 11:31.149
that wakanda
has lost her ability

11:31.233 --> 11:33.777
to protect our resources.

11:34.444 --> 11:38.073
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some

11:38.156 --> 11:41.326
to find vibranium
outside of wakanda,

11:41.410 --> 11:45.664
and wish you the best of luck.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.546
Pilot: This is rotor 625

11:52.629 --> 11:53.922
requesting clearance to land.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.279
Dr. Graham: All right.
Meet you down there.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.304
Yeah.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.018
I thought you retired!

12:06.101 --> 12:07.227
I thought I had too.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.521
They said that machine
had a one in a billion chance

12:09.605 --> 12:10.772
of finding vibranium.

12:10.856 --> 12:11.940
Oh, less than that.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.922
Here we go.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.066
Salazar:
Cabin pressure is stable

12:37.090 --> 12:38.926
at negative one p-s-i.

12:44.473 --> 12:45.891
At 800 feet,

12:45.974 --> 12:48.018
passing through thermocline.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.728
All my life supports
in the green.

12:51.855 --> 12:52.940
Copy you.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.659
Salazar: We've touched down.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.126
Dr. Graham:
Perfect. So, Salazar,

13:13.210 --> 13:14.836
you are near the site
right there.

13:16.088 --> 13:18.215
Salazar: Yeah, it's astonishing.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.551
The drill seemed to make contact

13:21.635 --> 13:23.011
with a metallic substance.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.306
Jackson: Whatever it is,
it's solid.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.684
I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.313
Smitty: I'll be.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.524
Vibranium in the ocean.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.567
Let's go ahead and get
the detector out of there,

13:37.651 --> 13:39.403
since it's the only one
we've got.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.864
Salazar: Heading towards
the vibranium detector.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.961
Okay, Salazar,
we just went dark.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.255
Salazar: Yeah.
The rig lost power.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.048
Copy that.
I'm gonna fix it up here.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.720
Jackson: What the hell was that?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.289
Salazar: Jackson,

14:32.372 --> 14:34.207
tell me you're seeing this?

14:34.291 --> 14:36.460
Dr. Graham: Hang on.
Salazar's heart rate.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.670
Hey, uh, Salazar,
can you give me a visual?

14:40.589 --> 14:42.799
Salazar:
It's a phantom jellyfish.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.509
I've never seen one this color.

14:45.177 --> 14:46.595
Emergency dive team, stand by.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.765
Salazar, uh,
we just lost Jackson's vitals.

14:49.848 --> 14:50.974
Can you see him?

14:58.690 --> 15:00.609
No. He's gone.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.694
Can you clarify? What do
you mean by, "he's gone"?

15:04.446 --> 15:05.947
Salazar, do you copy?

15:07.157 --> 15:08.825
Salazar?

15:11.953 --> 15:14.247
Man: Smitty,
we got a situation out here.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.260
What's that sound?

15:27.344 --> 15:29.387
West, you got a visual
on what's making that sound?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.395
West, how copy, over?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.150
West, you got a visual?

16:01.211 --> 16:02.730
Smitty: It's some kind
of Sonic attack.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.422
Hey, smitty, earplugs.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.764
We are under attack.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.724
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.936
Copy. Mayday, mayday,
this is rotor 625.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.455
We are requesting
assistance immediately.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.772
It's the wakandans.

16:22.858 --> 16:23.984
It has to be.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.626
Henderson.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.044
Smitty, we gotta go.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.129
Henderson!

16:45.213 --> 16:46.673
Let's go.

16:48.884 --> 16:49.885
What's going on?

16:50.552 --> 16:51.678
Get off the edge.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.384
Go, go, go, go!

17:38.558 --> 17:39.601
Now! Go!

17:39.684 --> 17:41.728
Spin! Spin them off!

17:42.604 --> 17:44.231
Okay. They're gone!

17:44.314 --> 17:46.441
Oh, my god!

18:04.960 --> 18:06.086
Dr. Graham: Just get us out.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.629
Pilot: We're good.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.047
We're good.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.257
Where is the strike team?

18:10.507 --> 18:12.634
It wasn't the wakandans.
They... they were blue.

18:12.717 --> 18:13.802
Everyone is dead...

18:16.054 --> 18:17.430
Shit. What is going on?

18:17.514 --> 18:19.349
Pilot: We're getting
pulled backwards.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.935
Oh, my god.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.858
Oh, god! Hang on!

19:03.727 --> 19:05.788
Anderson Cooper: Queen ramonda
of the nation of wakanda

19:05.812 --> 19:07.939
gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday,

19:08.023 --> 19:09.482
while members of her military

19:09.566 --> 19:11.234
escorted captive mercenaries

19:11.318 --> 19:12.777
onto the floor of the UN.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.696
A year has passed
since queen ramonda

19:14.779 --> 19:16.823
was reinstated
as ruler of wakanda

19:16.906 --> 19:18.408
after king t'challa's
sudden death

19:18.491 --> 19:20.452
from an undisclosed illness
last year.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.787
All eyes are on the tiny,
powerful nation,

19:22.871 --> 19:25.457
as it finds itself
increasingly isolated...

19:27.876 --> 19:29.711
Approaching the river border.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.719
We are home.

20:27.811 --> 20:28.978
Griot: Princess.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.105
Just a moment.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.523
I'm in the middle of something.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.233
Griot: I understand,
Princess, however...

20:33.316 --> 20:35.026
You're disrupting
my train of thought.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.447
Ramonda: Shuri.

20:39.989 --> 20:40.990
Mother.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.218
Griot: I was trying to tell you.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.244
The queen is here.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.454
- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.789
I think that one day

20:47.872 --> 20:50.166
artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.086
My ai isn't like the movies,
mother.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.879
It does exactly
what I tell it to do.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.549
Yeah, if only children
were the same.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.469
Everyone seems to be
working diligently.

21:02.137 --> 21:05.682
Yes. Rapid emergency
response task.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.475
There could be any number of

21:07.559 --> 21:09.227
unknown threats on the horizon,

21:09.310 --> 21:10.979
and they're creating solutions.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.023
Ramonda: Oh, what is this?

21:14.107 --> 21:15.817
Exo suits for our army.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.403
It grants the user
super-human strength,

21:18.486 --> 21:20.655
speed, and durability.

21:20.738 --> 21:23.158
But, as always, okoye had notes.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.492
What were her notes?

21:24.576 --> 21:25.952
She hates them.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.668
What about recreating
the heart-shaped herb?

21:33.751 --> 21:35.962
Have you made
any progress on that?

21:36.045 --> 21:37.255
Griot: Excuse me, Princess.

21:37.338 --> 21:40.550
Nakia, daughter of yaa,
is trying to reach you again.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.634
Maybe you should...

21:41.718 --> 21:43.470
Maybe you should
continue your calculations

21:43.553 --> 21:44.721
as I instructed.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.306
Griot: As you wish, Princess.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.350
We do not need the herb, mother.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.395
We need new technology.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.730
What of the black panther?

21:56.941 --> 22:00.612
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.864
The black panther
is a relic, mother.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.450
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the herb,

22:05.533 --> 22:07.702
I was trying to save my brother.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.164
Ramonda: Oh, shuri.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.679
Do you know what day it is?

22:26.763 --> 22:27.764
Tuesday.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.558
The date, child.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.066
Brother's passing.

22:38.733 --> 22:40.026
One year ago today.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.246
Have you planned anything?

22:51.329 --> 22:55.250
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.252
- Right now?
- Right now.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.546
And you can leave
your kimoyo beads here.

22:59.629 --> 23:00.755
- Mother.
- No, no.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.674
You won't need them
where we are going.

23:07.428 --> 23:10.390
And the other two. Yes.

23:34.163 --> 23:38.001
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.670
It is the only way
you are going to heal

23:40.753 --> 23:43.089
from the wound caused
by t'challa's death.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.465
I'm fine, mother.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.844
You don't have to worry
about me.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.724
He's gone,
but I'm moving forward.

23:52.807 --> 23:54.642
T'challa is dead,

23:54.726 --> 23:57.604
but that doesn't mean
he is gone.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.982
When that illness
took your brother from us,

24:01.149 --> 24:05.653
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.531
But I still took time
in the bush.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.951
I wandered until I found water.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.494
And I sat.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.789
Then I did this ritual

24:16.956 --> 24:19.334
that I am about to show you now.

24:21.919 --> 24:26.132
I found your brother
in the breeze,

24:27.425 --> 24:30.803
pushing me gently, but firm.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.973
Like his hand on my shoulder.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.810
It took some time,

24:39.187 --> 24:41.147
but he was there.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.780
He wasn't there, mother.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.033
The presence that you felt

24:52.116 --> 24:54.035
was just a construct
of your mind.

24:56.245 --> 24:59.999
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort orjoy.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.126
That's all.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.879
Hmm.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.886
What construct
does your mind create

25:12.053 --> 25:14.013
when you think of your brother?

25:14.972 --> 25:16.933
Does it offer you comfort?

25:18.309 --> 25:19.686
Or torment?

25:33.366 --> 25:34.450
Come, child.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.213
How did you get this?

25:47.380 --> 25:48.506
What does it matter?

25:49.340 --> 25:51.134
What does this have to do
with your ritual?

25:52.301 --> 25:54.637
Ramonda: Burning
of the funeral garments

25:54.804 --> 25:57.056
marks the end
of the mourning period

25:57.223 --> 26:00.143
and the beginning
of a new relationship

26:00.226 --> 26:02.478
with our loved ones
that have passed on...

26:02.979 --> 26:04.564
I'm not doing this, mother.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.275
If I sit

26:07.442 --> 26:09.986
and think about my brother
for too long,

26:11.487 --> 26:14.282
it won't be these clothes
I'll burn.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.076
It will be the world...

26:18.494 --> 26:20.037
And everyone in it.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.373
Shuri...

26:26.836 --> 26:29.756
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you

26:30.339 --> 26:31.549
about your brother.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.096
Mother, wait!

26:37.680 --> 26:39.640
What are you doing?

27:04.415 --> 27:06.334
This better not be
a part of your ritual.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.752
It isn't.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.047
Ramonda: Stop! Right there!

27:11.714 --> 27:14.550
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

27:16.093 --> 27:17.595
This place is amazing.

27:18.513 --> 27:20.598
The air is pristine.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.059
And the water...

27:24.602 --> 27:26.729
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

27:27.063 --> 27:30.233
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.735
That never have to change
who they were.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.404
What reason do you have

27:35.488 --> 27:37.281
to reveal your secret
to the world?

27:37.365 --> 27:40.326
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.370
Who are you?

27:42.537 --> 27:43.746
Man: I have many names.

27:44.372 --> 27:47.458
My people call me k'UK'ulkan...

27:50.378 --> 27:52.088
But my enemies call me namor.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.425
The American military
detected vibranium

27:56.509 --> 27:58.094
under my nation's domain.

27:59.095 --> 28:02.640
I was able to
stop them from minin' it,

28:03.558 --> 28:04.851
but we need wakanda's help

28:04.934 --> 28:06.686
to prevent it
from happenin' again.

28:07.812 --> 28:10.773
They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.

28:10.940 --> 28:13.442
Vibranium only exists here.

28:13.609 --> 28:14.944
In wakanda.

28:15.111 --> 28:16.487
Mother, he's covered in it.

28:20.366 --> 28:24.120
Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.998
In response,
other nations have begun

28:27.081 --> 28:28.499
searching the planet for it.

28:28.666 --> 28:32.086
His choice has compromised us.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.256
I think wakanda
could find the scientist

28:35.339 --> 28:36.632
and bring them to me?

28:37.383 --> 28:41.387
It is only fair that wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

28:41.554 --> 28:44.015
You do not sneak into my country

28:44.098 --> 28:46.809
and tell me what is fair.

28:48.269 --> 28:51.355
I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.

28:52.148 --> 28:54.859
And they have
incomparable strength.

28:55.359 --> 28:58.487
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.954
When you have the scientist,
blow into this,

29:07.121 --> 29:08.456
place it in the ocean.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.917
I'll be there
shortly afterwards.

29:14.462 --> 29:15.671
For your own sake,

29:16.172 --> 29:18.090
don't mention anything about me

29:18.174 --> 29:19.967
to anyone outside of wakanda.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.603
Did you see the wings
on his ankles?

29:46.994 --> 29:48.204
Shuri: How did he do that?

29:48.955 --> 29:50.581
Ramonda:
We must convene the council.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.210
Okoye: Heaven scrapers
had no evidence

29:54.293 --> 29:56.003
of any activity at all.

29:58.089 --> 30:02.927
Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?

30:03.010 --> 30:04.470
If my soldiers were present,

30:04.887 --> 30:07.098
this "fish man"

30:07.264 --> 30:09.100
would be bound before us
as we speak.

30:09.183 --> 30:11.435
If your muscle brains
were present,

30:11.602 --> 30:12.895
they would still be there

30:12.979 --> 30:14.772
choking on their
fuzzy adornments.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.107
You bald-headed demon...

30:16.190 --> 30:18.067
Show some respect, you two.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.235
M'Baku: Respect?

30:19.318 --> 30:21.821
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

30:21.904 --> 30:22.989
Watch your tone, Jabari!

30:36.419 --> 30:37.962
Okoye: As I was saying,

30:38.129 --> 30:40.923
there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.341
And nothing
on the radar as well.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.970
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

30:46.137 --> 30:47.638
Ramonda: He was not alone.

30:47.722 --> 30:50.016
And claims to command
a massive army.

30:50.099 --> 30:54.395
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

30:54.478 --> 30:55.521
So he can kill them?

30:55.604 --> 30:56.689
Do it.

30:58.983 --> 31:00.776
We never had to face an enemy

31:00.860 --> 31:02.611
with access to vibranium before.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.573
And we have no black panther
to protect us.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.283
M'Baku: That is because
this wise council

31:07.366 --> 31:09.952
allowed killmonger
to take the throne

31:10.119 --> 31:12.119
and burn up all of your
precious heart-shaped herb.

31:12.163 --> 31:14.665
M'Baku,
what would you have us do?

31:14.832 --> 31:17.209
We should find the fish man
and kill him.

31:18.002 --> 31:21.964
If we do
what he is asking for now,

31:22.131 --> 31:24.550
what is to stop him
from coming back

31:24.633 --> 31:26.427
and asking for more?

31:35.853 --> 31:36.896
Ramonda: As you were.

31:38.606 --> 31:42.735
Is it just me, or does this
keep getting uglier?

31:43.069 --> 31:44.070
It's you.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.781
- So, does it work?
- Yes.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.365
This thing can detect

31:48.449 --> 31:50.659
the altered frequency
of vibranium

31:50.826 --> 31:53.954
through water, stones,
even heavy metals.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.831
Whoever built this is brilliant.

31:56.165 --> 31:57.583
Come, look.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.836
Some are custom parts
and others look like

32:01.003 --> 32:02.755
they gathered it
from a junkyard.

32:02.922 --> 32:05.174
I am still struggling to believe

32:05.257 --> 32:08.219
that vibranium exists
outside of wakanda.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.638
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

32:10.805 --> 32:12.515
Our planet is covered
of mostly water,

32:12.598 --> 32:13.682
so it's reasonable

32:13.766 --> 32:15.810
that the other one
just landed there.

32:15.976 --> 32:18.062
This changes everything
that we know.

32:18.229 --> 32:21.690
The great mound.
All of the legends and fables.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.276
Those stories
are seared in my mind.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.237
That sounds very painful.

32:28.531 --> 32:30.533
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

32:32.159 --> 32:33.869
- I do have an idea.
- Ramonda: Mm.

32:34.662 --> 32:35.996
I'm going to need the Princess.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.165
Out of the question.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.459
She is in no state
to be in the field.

32:42.837 --> 32:45.381
It may
do her some good to get out.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.509
It might just be exactly
what she needs.

32:49.051 --> 32:52.012
Besides, I can do
this American operation

32:52.096 --> 32:53.180
with my eyes closed.

32:53.264 --> 32:56.475
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.060
This namor,

32:58.477 --> 33:00.479
he snuck past our defenses.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.565
That will never happen again.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.233
He was not alone.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.152
She'll be with me.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.404
Shuri: So,

33:09.363 --> 33:10.447
when are we leavin'

33:10.531 --> 33:12.700
so I can see
my favorite colonizer?

33:23.460 --> 33:24.646
Can't stop

33:24.670 --> 33:26.422
addicted to the shindig

33:26.505 --> 33:28.799
Chop top,
he says I'm gonna win big...

33:30.885 --> 33:31.886
Whoa.

33:31.969 --> 33:34.138
Distant cousin
to the reservation

33:34.221 --> 33:36.891
defunkt the pistol
that you pay for

33:36.974 --> 33:39.310
this punk, the feeling
that you stay for...

33:41.520 --> 33:42.855
Come on.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.317
Yeah, I got it.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.611
I got it.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.114
Will you slow down?

33:59.079 --> 34:00.372
You didn't think to call?

34:00.539 --> 34:01.916
Now, why would I have
your number?

34:04.501 --> 34:05.794
We are looking for the scientist

34:05.878 --> 34:07.671
who built
the vibranium detector.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.447
So it was you guys
in the Atlantic?

34:10.424 --> 34:12.092
Come on. Mining ship.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.510
Lot of casualties.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.221
What happened?

34:15.387 --> 34:16.429
Seriously?

34:18.431 --> 34:21.310
It was a joint operation.
Us and the seals.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.438
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers,

34:24.605 --> 34:25.606
friends of mine.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.065
Gone.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.275
Just like that.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.735
You throw in the fact

34:29.818 --> 34:30.879
that they were tracking
vibranium...

34:30.902 --> 34:33.572
I can assure you wakanda
had nothing to do with this.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.574
So who was it?

34:37.159 --> 34:39.039
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work

34:39.119 --> 34:41.246
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.998
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.252
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist

34:46.418 --> 34:47.920
before anything else happens.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.505
You owe me, Ross.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.174
You owe my brother.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.012
Okay, look.

34:57.805 --> 35:00.057
There are agents who have
been sentenced to death

35:00.224 --> 35:02.309
for less than
I'm about to give you now.

35:02.476 --> 35:03.727
And we got a new director.

35:04.395 --> 35:05.771
She's watching me like a hawk.

35:05.938 --> 35:08.524
We will be very, very careful.

35:08.691 --> 35:10.776
Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.444
The us needs another machine

35:12.528 --> 35:14.172
and this kid is
the only person in the world

35:14.196 --> 35:15.447
who knows how to build one.

35:15.531 --> 35:16.573
So they're comin' for her.

35:16.657 --> 35:17.657
A kid?

35:27.751 --> 35:29.753
- Hey.
- You forgot to venmo me.

35:29.837 --> 35:33.090
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

35:33.173 --> 35:34.925
Eight hundred
was yesterday's price.

35:35.009 --> 35:36.176
It's a band today.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.970
That's predatory. I...

35:39.179 --> 35:40.931
I built the whole robotic hand.

35:41.015 --> 35:43.559
You just corrected
the grip algorithm.

35:43.726 --> 35:45.102
And what grade did you get?

35:50.816 --> 35:52.568
Thanks.

35:55.571 --> 35:56.798
Shuri: Is that an iPhone I see?

35:56.822 --> 35:57.823
Okoye: Primitive.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.203
We have located the scientist.

36:03.287 --> 36:05.039
She is
in the American equivalent

36:05.122 --> 36:06.874
of a wakandan village school.

36:06.957 --> 36:08.167
Ramon da: A school?

36:08.667 --> 36:11.086
Please tell me
it is a professor.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.047
It's a student, mother.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.631
We can't give her to namor.

36:15.466 --> 36:18.135
Ramonda: Bring this student
back to wakanda.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.042
I've got it from here.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.186
Wait. Maybe I should
speak with her.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.645
It will be more discreet.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.065
I can be discreet.

36:34.818 --> 36:35.819
What?

36:36.236 --> 36:37.404
- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?

36:38.572 --> 36:39.758
It's the wrong shade, isn't it?

36:39.782 --> 36:40.866
It's the right shade.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.534
Fenty 440. You look good.

36:44.161 --> 36:46.121
I can blend in as a student.

36:47.247 --> 36:48.248
I can do this.

36:52.086 --> 36:53.587
- You get five minutes.
- Yes!

37:05.849 --> 37:06.850
Girl: Yo!

37:07.017 --> 37:08.102
Riri Williams?

37:11.522 --> 37:13.065
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.268
You gotta go to the website.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.611
It's an encrypted file.

37:17.778 --> 37:18.946
I wanted to airdrop it.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.281
You the...

37:22.825 --> 37:23.826
Whew.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.494
You're Princess shuri.

37:27.079 --> 37:28.664
What the hell
are you doing here?

37:28.831 --> 37:30.457
Oh, shit,
am I getting recruited?

37:33.794 --> 37:35.587
I'm here about
the vibranium detector

37:35.671 --> 37:37.172
that you built for the CIA.

37:38.674 --> 37:40.843
I ain't built no detector
for no CIA.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.594
I made that
for my metallurgy class.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.763
- A school project?
- Riri: Yeah.

37:45.139 --> 37:46.932
My professor said
I'd never be able to do it.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.602
To be young, gifted,
and black though, right?

37:53.730 --> 37:55.899
Y'all probably don't say that
in wakanda.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.236
How old are you?

38:00.195 --> 38:01.488
Nineteen.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.157
Brilliance at a young age

38:03.240 --> 38:05.784
is not always accepted
by the elders.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.787
How long did it take you?

38:08.954 --> 38:10.038
Couple months.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.874
- Couple months?
- The hardest part was

38:11.957 --> 38:13.797
finding big enough
mylar sheets to cover the...

38:15.544 --> 38:17.087
Wait, did I piss offwakanda?

38:17.171 --> 38:18.255
Not just us.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.340
This place is no longer safe
for you.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.635
Gather your things
and come with me. Right now.

38:24.511 --> 38:27.514
I got differential equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.

38:30.017 --> 38:31.018
Okay.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.312
Okay.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.689
You wait right here.

38:36.523 --> 38:39.193
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

38:39.610 --> 38:40.611
Ooh!

38:42.654 --> 38:44.281
Shuri: I had it under control.

38:45.199 --> 38:47.701
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.536
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

38:50.204 --> 38:51.371
Get out!

38:51.538 --> 38:52.539
Hey.

38:52.706 --> 38:55.542
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step

38:55.626 --> 38:56.627
- toward me!
- Oh!

38:56.710 --> 38:57.937
See how they teach the children

38:57.961 --> 38:59.254
to treat their guests? Mm!

39:03.175 --> 39:04.259
Oh...

39:04.343 --> 39:05.677
You brought a spear in here?

39:05.761 --> 39:08.138
You brought a spear in here.

39:08.847 --> 39:09.973
I like her.

39:10.474 --> 39:11.642
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.286
- Put it down, put it...
- Riri: Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

39:13.310 --> 39:14.895
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.647
Okoye: It's all right, Princess.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.065
Small, small girl.

39:19.149 --> 39:22.069
I am going to give you
two options.

39:22.236 --> 39:24.404
You can come to wakanda,

39:24.571 --> 39:26.865
conscious or unconscious.

39:27.658 --> 39:30.410
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.538
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

39:34.456 --> 39:36.500
- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.044
- Mm-hmm. I told you!
- You look good.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.879
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

39:41.338 --> 39:42.714
And she can deal

39:42.798 --> 39:45.467
with that merman
with the winged ankles

39:45.634 --> 39:48.554
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.847
- You got this.
- Mm, with your heater.

39:50.931 --> 39:52.371
Shuri: Come on. Let's go.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.100
What?

40:01.191 --> 40:02.943
Okoye: What exactly
is this place?

40:03.652 --> 40:05.772
Riri: I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

40:06.446 --> 40:10.242
He lets me work out
of this garage in exchange.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.327
I just have to grab
my work laptop.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.833
Please don't touch anything.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.127
Okoye: You don't have to worry
about that.

40:20.294 --> 40:21.712
Riri: It may not look like much,

40:21.795 --> 40:23.797
but it's my life's work in here.

40:23.880 --> 40:24.881
Okoye: Mm-hmm.

40:24.965 --> 40:28.385
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

40:28.552 --> 40:29.553
Yeah.

40:29.636 --> 40:32.598
And you just leave it
on a desk in a car garage?

40:32.764 --> 40:35.726
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

40:35.892 --> 40:39.021
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

40:39.187 --> 40:41.106
Riri: Took me the whole
semester to get back in.

40:41.273 --> 40:43.317
Had to build a functional
quantum computer

40:43.483 --> 40:45.402
just to crack my own encryption.

40:45.569 --> 40:47.946
What is it you're building
here? Is it stark tech?

40:48.030 --> 40:49.448
I said don't touch anything.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.241
Griot: Princess,
American law enforcement

40:51.325 --> 40:52.701
has arrived at your location.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.244
- Shuri: Shit.
- Who was that?

40:54.661 --> 40:55.662
My ai.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.749
Okoye: They are surrounding us.

41:02.753 --> 41:05.380
I thought you said a merman
was after me.

41:05.547 --> 41:06.590
That's the feds.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.481
Oh, I do not need this shit
right now!

41:22.564 --> 41:24.775
I swear to god,
I was doing so well!

41:24.941 --> 41:27.569
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

41:27.653 --> 41:30.280
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of wakanda

41:30.364 --> 41:32.032
is gonna show up at my doorstep

41:32.115 --> 41:33.742
and then shit about to pop off.

41:33.825 --> 41:34.826
I think

41:34.910 --> 41:37.579
that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,

41:37.663 --> 41:41.375
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

41:41.541 --> 41:44.961
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

41:45.045 --> 41:46.522
FBI agent:
This is the federal bureau

41:46.546 --> 41:47.547
of in vestigation.

41:47.631 --> 41:48.733
Because of your little machine.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.133
So those popo out there...

41:50.217 --> 41:51.402
FBI agent: We have
surrounded the premises.

41:51.426 --> 41:52.570
Are the very least
of your worries.

41:52.594 --> 41:55.138
Listen, we need to work
together to get out of here.

41:55.305 --> 41:57.724
General,
they've got us surrounded.

41:57.891 --> 41:59.476
Maybe we should just split up.

41:59.559 --> 42:01.061
Out of the question.

42:01.228 --> 42:02.354
Does this vehicle work?

42:05.941 --> 42:09.236
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

42:09.403 --> 42:11.238
Don't even think about it.

42:11.321 --> 42:13.407
Besides, there are three of us.

42:13.573 --> 42:16.034
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

42:16.410 --> 42:17.661
Shuri: Whoo!

42:17.744 --> 42:18.995
I knew it.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.581
Don't tell me that
you built this in two months.

42:21.665 --> 42:24.710
I spent years
on this. On and off.

42:24.793 --> 42:27.671
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

42:27.838 --> 42:28.964
That thing can fly?

42:29.047 --> 42:31.007
There's an entire
YouTube channel

42:31.091 --> 42:32.884
dedicated to sightings of me.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.052
Shuri: That's awesome.

42:34.511 --> 42:35.863
FBI agent: We have
a warrant to detain...

42:35.887 --> 42:37.647
- Shuri: Come.
- The student riri Williams.

42:37.723 --> 42:38.932
Wireless transmitter,

42:39.015 --> 42:40.100
so we can communicate.

42:40.183 --> 42:41.309
Don't try to scurry off.

42:41.393 --> 42:43.520
FBI agent: General okoye,
Princess shuri,

42:43.687 --> 42:45.731
come out with your hands up.

42:46.440 --> 42:47.566
Okoye: What a hunk ofjunk.

42:47.649 --> 42:49.526
Hey, please be careful.

42:49.609 --> 42:50.962
FBI agent: You will not
be placed under arrest.

42:50.986 --> 42:51.987
Keys are on the seat.

42:52.154 --> 42:53.756
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge,

42:53.780 --> 42:55.091
we can lose them
in Boston traffic.

42:55.115 --> 42:56.992
General,
we really need to split up.

42:57.159 --> 42:59.244
Listen to me.
We are not in your lab.

42:59.327 --> 43:00.412
We are in the field.

43:00.579 --> 43:01.997
Now, get her in the car.

43:02.581 --> 43:03.707
Always shouting at me.

43:10.505 --> 43:12.674
Griot: The tactical unit
will breach the entrance

43:12.758 --> 43:15.635
in three, two,

43:15.802 --> 43:17.137
one.

43:18.513 --> 43:20.140
FBI! Don't move!

43:20.807 --> 43:21.927
What the hell is that?

43:21.975 --> 43:24.311
Oh, shit!
She got an iron man suit?

43:24.394 --> 43:26.354
- Fall back!
- Stay where you are!

43:29.900 --> 43:31.026
Okoye: Guess it can fly.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.486
Shuri: Griot!
Griot: Yes, Princess.

43:32.569 --> 43:34.196
- Now!
- Remote piloting activated.

43:34.279 --> 43:35.530
Okoye: Shuri! No!

43:39.910 --> 43:43.205
Clip, pole, smoke, fade

43:43.288 --> 43:44.372
they want the drip

43:44.456 --> 43:46.917
Let's go!

43:48.126 --> 43:49.127
Shuri: Griot.

43:50.295 --> 43:51.588
Give me a visual.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.024
They want the glow
they want my soul

43:53.048 --> 43:54.591
they want the wave 1 keep a clip

43:54.674 --> 43:55.675
I keep a pole

43:55.759 --> 43:58.053
who want the smoke
who want the fade

43:59.679 --> 44:01.097
okoye: Griot...
Griot: Yes, general?

44:01.181 --> 44:03.058
Take me to the Princess

44:03.225 --> 44:05.894
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your cpu,

44:06.061 --> 44:07.354
you will not be able to process

44:07.437 --> 44:09.231
basic input for a millennia.

44:09.397 --> 44:10.677
Griot: Just one moment, general.

44:10.816 --> 44:12.192
Shuri: Okoye,
I'm on my way to you.

44:12.275 --> 44:14.277
Bounce, crouch or get slouched

44:14.361 --> 44:15.654
my whole hood devout

44:17.864 --> 44:19.282
My mama taught me
not to be a harlot

44:19.366 --> 44:21.409
my granny help me
take the wise route

44:21.493 --> 44:23.245
although I'm itty bitty
sitting pretty

44:23.328 --> 44:26.456
griot, give me control
of this vehicle right now!

44:26.623 --> 44:28.667
Griot: I am clearing you a path.

44:33.463 --> 44:34.798
She's all yours, general.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.758
Manual drive engaged.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.521
Look, I know you on my bumper

44:49.604 --> 44:51.398
I know you want my thunder

44:51.481 --> 44:53.400
why the laws wanna take us under

44:53.483 --> 44:54.943
we need to find
an extraction point.

44:55.110 --> 44:56.611
Shuri: There's one
across the river.

44:56.695 --> 44:58.321
I know you want my thunder

44:58.405 --> 45:00.156
why the laws wanna take us under

45:00.240 --> 45:02.117
why the hell am I in this jungle

45:02.826 --> 45:04.327
hey, yo, they cuttin' off
the bridge.

45:08.582 --> 45:10.709
Griot: Princess,
there is a surveillance drone

45:10.792 --> 45:12.586
- locked onto you.
- How high?

45:12.752 --> 45:14.087
Griot: Thirty-thousand feet.

45:14.713 --> 45:16.553
We don't cry 'bout
how they try take us all out

45:17.007 --> 45:18.508
-look -they want the drip

45:19.009 --> 45:20.010
they want my soul

45:20.093 --> 45:21.094
hang on.

45:21.803 --> 45:22.804
I got it.

45:26.474 --> 45:27.475
Come on, riri.

45:27.893 --> 45:30.145
You gotta find
these differential equations.

45:30.312 --> 45:32.105
Once the relative velocity
evens out...

45:32.188 --> 45:34.148
Shuri: Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone

45:34.232 --> 45:35.233
without an oxygen mask.

45:37.861 --> 45:40.530
Griot: Oxygen level is now 55%.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.617
Riri: Twenty-eight
thousand feet.

45:44.743 --> 45:47.329
Griot: Oxygen level is now 30%.

45:50.457 --> 45:51.893
Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust

45:51.917 --> 45:53.460
my euler angles
and that should...

45:54.210 --> 45:55.570
That should drop it
right on the...

46:01.968 --> 46:03.803
Griot: Oxygen, 0%.

46:07.182 --> 46:09.142
The drone is no longer
tracking you.

46:10.060 --> 46:12.062
Altitude, 500 feet and falling.

46:12.145 --> 46:13.585
Shuri: Riri! Are you okay?

46:14.731 --> 46:15.774
- Riri!
- Yea h.

46:19.361 --> 46:20.445
I'm good.

46:21.363 --> 46:23.123
Officer: Incoming!
Woman: Get out of the way!

46:23.823 --> 46:24.926
- Shit!
- Riri: And no worries.

46:24.950 --> 46:26.952
I got a special delivery
for y'all in three,

46:27.118 --> 46:28.536
two, one...

46:30.080 --> 46:31.164
Shuri: Nice one, riri!

46:31.247 --> 46:32.582
We got the glow we got the soul

46:32.666 --> 46:33.875
we got the wave

46:33.959 --> 46:35.418
riri: Whool

46:40.423 --> 46:41.466
Shuri: Riri!

47:08.493 --> 47:11.579
What just happened? Shun!

47:12.122 --> 47:13.123
Shun!

47:29.222 --> 47:31.474
Griot: The Princess's vitals
are stable, general.

47:31.641 --> 47:34.227
She should regain
consciousness momentarily.

48:08.678 --> 48:10.764
Take another step closer

48:11.556 --> 48:13.058
and iwill kill you all.

48:13.767 --> 48:15.327
Officer: Drop your weapons!

48:23.568 --> 48:24.768
Hey, is she blue?

48:29.574 --> 48:30.774
Drop your weapon!

50:44.667 --> 50:45.752
Shuri: Okoye!

50:47.253 --> 50:48.254
Wait!

50:48.338 --> 50:49.714
Griot: Activating
interpretation.

50:49.797 --> 50:51.025
I'm shuri.

50:51.049 --> 50:52.342
Princess of wakanda.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.594
I demand that you take me
to namor.

50:54.761 --> 50:56.846
Do not bring harm to this girl.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.643
Griot:
Do we take them both alive?

51:01.935 --> 51:04.229
Griot: Yes, attuma.

51:20.536 --> 51:21.663
Griot: Breathe.

51:30.588 --> 51:31.589
Shun!

51:50.024 --> 51:52.694
Ross, from the agency.
You got any witnesses?

51:52.860 --> 51:55.071
None. But we think
it was the wakandans.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.447
Excuse me?

51:56.531 --> 51:57.716
Our field office
got a tip from Langley

51:57.740 --> 51:58.741
that they were coming.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.702
Right. Who made that call?

52:01.744 --> 52:03.344
- She did.
- Agent: Director de fontaine.

52:05.540 --> 52:06.916
Director de fontaine.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.001
Really?

52:08.084 --> 52:09.085
Well...

52:10.086 --> 52:11.963
Uh, agent thinks
it was the wakandans.

52:12.505 --> 52:14.007
Yeah, we've been
on every one of them

52:14.090 --> 52:15.150
since they took out our ship.

52:15.174 --> 52:16.592
That's why I wanted you here.

52:17.677 --> 52:18.761
You're lookin' good.

52:18.845 --> 52:20.430
Oh. Well, I try.

52:20.596 --> 52:22.098
De fontaine: You put
that home gym in?

52:22.181 --> 52:23.182
Ross: Yeah. Last year.

52:23.349 --> 52:26.060
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your peloton.

52:26.811 --> 52:27.812
Howdy.

52:27.895 --> 52:29.707
- I'm special agent in charge.
- Oh, good for you.

52:29.731 --> 52:31.899
You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?

52:32.066 --> 52:34.235
- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.

52:34.319 --> 52:35.799
- All right.
- So, what happened here?

52:36.154 --> 52:37.739
Um, we think it was a car crash,

52:37.905 --> 52:39.657
but we're having trouble
finding the cars.

52:39.741 --> 52:40.843
De fontaine: What do you mean?

52:40.867 --> 52:42.219
It was just like this
when you found it?

52:42.243 --> 52:43.929
Special agent: Yes.
We think someone involved

52:43.953 --> 52:44.954
got rid of the vehicles.

52:45.038 --> 52:46.265
De fontaine:
Got rid of them how?

52:46.289 --> 52:47.891
Special agent: They dumped
them into the river.

52:47.915 --> 52:49.155
De fontaine: You're kidding me.

52:50.168 --> 52:51.753
It's got an mit sticker on it.

52:51.919 --> 52:54.297
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

52:54.464 --> 52:56.549
Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?

52:56.716 --> 52:58.384
Can you give me a ride
back to Langley?

52:58.468 --> 53:00.678
Ross: It's an eight-hour drive.

53:00.762 --> 53:02.281
De fontaine: Yeah.
We can talk about the case.

53:02.305 --> 53:04.682
Actually, wouldn't mind...

53:04.766 --> 53:06.934
Apologizing to you
for a couple of things I said

53:07.018 --> 53:08.061
during our marriage.

53:11.439 --> 53:12.690
Okoye: They were blue.

53:13.733 --> 53:15.568
And they had
superhuman strength.

53:16.486 --> 53:19.322
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

53:20.198 --> 53:21.866
I struck down three of them

53:21.949 --> 53:23.429
with blows
that should've killed them,

53:23.493 --> 53:25.203
but they Rose again.

53:25.370 --> 53:28.623
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our Princess.

53:40.426 --> 53:41.636
Ramonda: Okoye,

53:42.011 --> 53:44.430
you will be
stripped of your rank

53:44.514 --> 53:46.516
as general of wakanda's armies

53:46.599 --> 53:49.560
and your status as dora milaje.

53:57.860 --> 53:58.903
You may.

54:02.865 --> 54:04.325
I have given everything.

54:05.284 --> 54:09.080
Let me die saving my country
and that throne.

54:11.416 --> 54:13.209
Allow me to make this right.

54:13.292 --> 54:14.585
"Make it right"?

54:16.212 --> 54:19.340
I do not know if my daughter
is alive or dead.

54:19.507 --> 54:22.760
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

54:22.844 --> 54:24.178
M'Baku: Mmm.

54:24.846 --> 54:29.225
She raised a spear against
her own husband for wakanda.

54:29.392 --> 54:31.936
Where is her
treacherous husband now

54:32.103 --> 54:36.399
but in a place where she can
visit if she wished? Mine...

54:37.692 --> 54:39.569
Is with the ancestors.

54:39.652 --> 54:44.449
I am queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,

54:44.615 --> 54:47.827
and my entire family is gone!

54:48.661 --> 54:51.456
Have I not given everything?

55:00.631 --> 55:02.550
On your feet, general.

55:08.723 --> 55:10.933
I stood by you

55:11.100 --> 55:14.729
after killmonger
took the throne,

55:14.896 --> 55:18.483
and you and the elders
in this room stood by him

55:18.649 --> 55:22.278
while I ran begging
to the Jabari for protection.

55:23.654 --> 55:25.072
And I warned you

55:25.156 --> 55:28.034
about taking my daughter
on this mission,

55:28.201 --> 55:30.119
and you lost her.

55:30.870 --> 55:32.371
So, today,

55:33.289 --> 55:35.458
I am done.

56:21.546 --> 56:24.090
Are you here, griot?

56:25.424 --> 56:26.676
Griot: Yes, my queen.

56:27.718 --> 56:31.097
Were you with shuri
when she was abducted?

56:31.264 --> 56:32.557
Griot: I was.

56:32.723 --> 56:35.476
Are you able to track
her kimoyo beads?

56:35.643 --> 56:38.062
De fontaine: Ballistics found
slugs all over Cambridge.

56:38.145 --> 56:40.231
Those wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

56:40.314 --> 56:41.315
Ross: Hmm.

56:41.399 --> 56:43.199
I can't see how
they figured out who built it.

56:43.234 --> 56:45.653
That information
is highly classified.

56:48.906 --> 56:49.907
What is that?

56:49.991 --> 56:51.409
- That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.

56:52.743 --> 56:54.829
Uh, director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

56:54.912 --> 56:56.122
It's enough with the titles.

56:56.205 --> 56:57.373
Just take it. I don't care.

56:57.456 --> 56:58.666
Hey, honey sweetheart.

56:58.749 --> 57:00.376
Ooh.

57:00.459 --> 57:03.004
Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.

57:03.713 --> 57:05.089
Actually, she's leaving.

57:05.256 --> 57:06.257
All right.

57:06.424 --> 57:08.884
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

57:16.267 --> 57:17.768
Everett Ross.

57:17.935 --> 57:19.061
Queen ramonda?

57:19.228 --> 57:21.188
What are you doing
with shuri's kimoyo beads?

57:21.272 --> 57:23.232
I didn't know they were hers.
All right?

57:23.316 --> 57:25.568
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

57:26.611 --> 57:27.737
Do you have the student?

57:28.613 --> 57:31.574
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

57:32.491 --> 57:33.951
What? Taken by who?

57:35.536 --> 57:37.580
My agency assumes it was you.

57:37.663 --> 57:39.707
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact

57:39.790 --> 57:42.043
that I pointed shuri and okoye
in the right direction.

57:42.209 --> 57:43.919
Look, if they're in danger,
I wanna help.

57:44.003 --> 57:45.921
But I can't if I don't know
what's going on.

57:46.088 --> 57:48.799
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.177
A country
that's already on our radar?

57:51.260 --> 57:52.261
Or you mean someone else?

57:52.345 --> 57:54.347
Ramonda: That is all I can say for now.

57:54.513 --> 57:55.514
Please,

57:55.931 --> 57:58.601
alert me if your government
decides to act

57:58.684 --> 58:00.269
on their suspicions.

58:00.353 --> 58:01.520
Yeah. Sure.

58:02.104 --> 58:06.108
Uh, look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

58:06.275 --> 58:08.069
I owe shuri my life.

58:08.819 --> 58:12.740
Griot, did shuri have
her earrings with her?

58:12.907 --> 58:15.451
Griot: I lost track of them
in the north Atlantic,

58:15.618 --> 58:18.788
but the people who took her
spoke yucatec Mayan.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.921
- Hmm?
- Girl 1: Oui, miss nakia.

59:19.390 --> 59:20.641
Queen mother.

59:22.476 --> 59:24.770
Everything is a lesson here
for the children.

59:24.937 --> 59:27.940
They painted the walls,
they feed the fish,

59:28.107 --> 59:30.401
and they grow
everything we eat here.

59:30.568 --> 59:33.195
I recognize
some of the concepts here.

59:33.362 --> 59:35.322
But you are using
different material.

59:35.489 --> 59:38.826
Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.

59:40.828 --> 59:44.165
You were missed
at t'challa's funeral.

59:55.926 --> 59:57.136
Queen mother.

59:57.303 --> 01:00:00.264
Ramonda: It's been six years
since you left us.

01:00:00.431 --> 01:00:03.601
I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.855
I was afraid

01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:12.526
of how final
the funeral would be.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:15.654
Nakia, daughter of yaa,

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:20.826
wherever you go,
you are still wakandan,

01:00:20.993 --> 01:00:24.622
and you know
death is not the end.

01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:37.510
How is everyone at home?

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:40.012
Shuri has been taken.

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:41.722
What?

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.142
You have infiltrated
many nations before.

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.955
I was a different person then.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:52.024
I need someone who can find
where she is being held,

01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:55.236
and rescue her,
without being seen.

01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:58.447
Who on earth would risk war
with wakanda?

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:01.909
Riri: Oh, my god.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.285
Shuri: Okay, breathe. Breathe.

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:04.829
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:05.996
Where the hell are we?

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.290
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:09.375
Oh, my god!

01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:11.502
What is that?

01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:14.421
Shuri: Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:16.423
Shuri: Just calm down.

01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:18.717
Okay, is there, like,
a new black panther

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:20.241
that you can call
to come and get us?

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.221
Why not?

01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:24.098
Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:26.433
The black panther is gone.

01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:28.245
So y'all stopped
having black panthers

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:29.270
when I get kidnapped?

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:44.535
Do you understand her?

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.203
Not completely.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:49.498
Nuh-uh.

01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:52.001
That is some supervillain shit
right there.

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:53.502
That's in every movie.

01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:54.920
Princess Leia.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:56.367
Belle from beauty and the beast.

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:59.049
That white chick
from Indiana Jones.

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:00.259
It's fine.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.887
You should see what I have
to wear at warrior falls.

01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:12.730
Wait.

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:15.274
You're not leaving me in here,
are you?

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:16.817
I'm coming back.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:18.694
I'm coming back.

01:02:18.861 --> 01:02:20.779
Stay calm.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.452
Princess.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:32.619
Welcome.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.041
Please, feel free.

01:04:44.298 --> 01:04:45.591
This is beautiful.

01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:48.177
That was my mother's.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.773
These are all
mesoamerican artifacts.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.109
Most likely 16th century.

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:07.529
Have you been alive since then?

01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:11.033
Your mother was human.

01:05:12.493 --> 01:05:13.494
She was.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.871
Then she became something else.

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:18.082
- How?
- "How?"

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:21.126
"How" is never
as important as "why."

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:33.847
Namor: My mother and her village

01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:35.516
were driven from their farms

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:39.436
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.481
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:45.984
Facing starvation,

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.986
war, and disease,

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.239
my people turned to chaac...

01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:53.784
Our god of rain and abundance.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:58.831
Chaac gave our shaman
a vision...

01:05:58.914 --> 01:06:01.583
A way to save his people.

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:09.967
Namor: Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.649
My mother was pregnant with me
at the time,

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:28.068
and she did not want to
ingest the plant

01:06:28.235 --> 01:06:30.445
for fear
of what it may do to me.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.491
But the shaman was convincing.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.192
Namor: They all fell sick.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.195
And their lives,

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.488
their existence there,

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:14.948
ended.

01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:29.087
The plant took away
their ability to breathe air

01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:33.050
but enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.138
They settled in the ocean,

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.934
away from war and diseases.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:13.257
My mother gave birth to me there

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:16.801
and I became
the firstborn son of talokan.

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:19.345
The plant gave me wings
on my ankles

01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:21.932
and ears
that pointed to the clouds.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:23.642
I was a mutant.

01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:27.813
I could swim in the sky
and age slower.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.482
Breathe the air
our ancestors breathed.

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.318
As she grew older,

01:08:34.653 --> 01:08:38.240
my mother mourned the life
on land that she once knew...

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:41.910
And died with a broken heart.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.290
She made me promise

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:48.625
to Bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:56.675
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:45.015
A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:47.059
As he died by my hand,

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.268
he called me...

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.901
The child without love.

01:09:56.443 --> 01:09:57.903
And I took my name from there.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:04.993
"Namor."

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.996
Because I have no love
for the surface world.

01:10:09.998 --> 01:10:12.084
Why are you telling me
all of this?

01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:16.630
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:18.382
What if we took her to wakanda?

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:20.967
Let us go.

01:10:21.927 --> 01:10:23.387
I give you my word.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.013
She will remain in my country.

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:26.681
I cannot risk that, Princess.

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.475
Then keep me instead.

01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:32.062
I'd love to see your nation.

01:10:33.397 --> 01:10:36.024
Well, you can't go
down there in that.

01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:41.530
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:43.949
Your blood will become toxic

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:45.450
and the pressure of the ocean

01:10:45.534 --> 01:10:47.953
will break every bone
in your body.

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:52.559
Or you can wear a suit.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.459
We have some of them. Come on.

01:10:57.546 --> 01:10:58.547
Stay close.

01:12:02.903 --> 01:12:04.571
Shuri: Hey! Namor, wait!

01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:50.742
Shuri: Whoa!

01:14:08.153 --> 01:14:09.613
Hello.

01:14:38.183 --> 01:14:39.309
It's beautiful.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.479
It's made of vibranium.

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:43.647
Namor: Yes.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.315
In the depths of the ocean,

01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:47.984
I brought the sun to my people.

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:51.196
I know you wished me

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:53.531
to spare the life
of the scientist.

01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:56.159
But now you see
what I have to protect.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:23.061
Griot: Nakia,
your hunch was correct.

01:15:23.228 --> 01:15:26.231
I have picked up a location
on shuri's kimoyo earrings.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:02.225
Griot: The signal is coming
from an unden/vater cavern

01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:05.854
approximately 140 meters
below the surface.

01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:08.773
Queen mother,
I've found her signal.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.067
It's coming
from an underwater cave.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.069
If she's down there,

01:16:13.153 --> 01:16:14.779
I'm sure
I'll encounter resistance.

01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:17.657
How would you like me
to proceed?

01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:22.954
Retrieve the Princess
by any means necessary.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:26.332
I will attempt
to draw namor out.

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:02.911
You are the first person
from the surface

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:04.496
to come to talokan.

01:17:05.497 --> 01:17:07.540
Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:17.300
It was made with the plant
that saved talokan.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.471
You are young, Princess.

01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:25.266
When you age as I do,
you realize

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:28.186
we all lose everyone we love.

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:29.938
But when I lost my brother,

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:31.731
it just felt different.

01:17:31.898 --> 01:17:33.566
He suffered in silence.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:37.153
When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.

01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:39.948
How does that make sense

01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:44.577
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:47.497
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.963
I don't have an answer
for that question.

01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:59.634
My ancestors would often say,

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.429
"only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.352
I admire
what you have built here.

01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:14.107
And how you've protected
your people.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:17.944
But as Princess of wakanda,

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:20.572
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:25.368
My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.

01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:28.913
I'm not leaving without her.

01:18:29.664 --> 01:18:33.376
We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.756
It is no longer
about the scientist.

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.468
For centuries,
the surface nations

01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:45.346
have conquered and enslaved
people like us.

01:18:46.014 --> 01:18:47.473
Over resources.

01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:51.144
Since the day
I buried my mother,

01:18:51.311 --> 01:18:52.937
I have prepared my people

01:18:53.021 --> 01:18:55.148
for the time
they will come for us.

01:18:55.315 --> 01:18:59.527
And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:06.743
I need to know if wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.037
There is no in-between.

01:19:11.164 --> 01:19:14.876
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.795
and you want wakanda
to help you?

01:19:18.713 --> 01:19:19.881
That's madness.

01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:23.051
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder wakanda

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:24.677
if given a chance.

01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.931
If we make an alliance,

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:30.808
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:35.605
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:38.399
the scientist will be returned
to wakanda.

01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:41.611
And if wakanda
does not accept, what then?

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.656
The scientist will die.

01:19:45.657 --> 01:19:48.576
And wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:50.370
An attack on my people?

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:52.163
Yes.

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:54.707
And I want you to listen to me.

01:19:54.874 --> 01:19:57.835
Wakanda cannot win a war
with talokan.

01:20:09.681 --> 01:20:11.891
I heard you that night,

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:13.977
with your mother at the river.

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:18.022
You said you wanted
to burn the world.

01:20:24.195 --> 01:20:25.697
Let us burn it together.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.557
Us secretary of state:
Queen ramonda

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.250
won't sell us any vibranium.

01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:39.544
And now they abducted
a young woman

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:40.878
who built the machine.

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:42.338
Yeah, with all due respect,

01:20:42.422 --> 01:20:44.048
riri Williams is a child prodigy

01:20:44.132 --> 01:20:46.342
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:47.969
The wakandans
were recruiting her

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.387
as part of their
outreach program.

01:20:49.554 --> 01:20:50.972
Nothing more. And then,

01:20:51.139 --> 01:20:53.516
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night

01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:55.685
to arrest the crown Princess

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.103
of an international superpower.

01:21:00.273 --> 01:21:01.993
The president wants
to take offensive action

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:03.067
against wakanda.

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:06.362
What type of offensive action?

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:08.614
Destabilization.

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:13.119
Well, special officer Ross
is our expert.

01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:15.496
So, Ross, what do you think?

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:17.165
My sources are telling me

01:21:17.248 --> 01:21:18.648
that there's someone else
out there.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.295
- Another nation?
- Ross: Could be. I don't know.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:22.438
You've gotta give me enough time

01:21:22.462 --> 01:21:23.605
to investigate this properly,

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.757
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:27.759
with a country
whose military capacity

01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:29.802
we can't even comprehend.

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:32.388
Director?

01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:35.099
I think he's the expert.

01:21:35.183 --> 01:21:38.186
I think it would be a mistake
to attack wakanda.

01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:45.985
Ramonda: Yes?

01:21:46.069 --> 01:21:47.069
We have a problem.

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.968
Is my daughter alive?

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:13.096
The Princess is alive and well.

01:22:13.805 --> 01:22:16.641
She requested
to be taken to talokan.

01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:19.185
She will remain there
for the time being.

01:22:22.814 --> 01:22:26.067
What can I offer you
in exchange?

01:22:26.484 --> 01:22:27.485
Nothing.

01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:29.654
I beg to differ.

01:22:29.821 --> 01:22:33.491
The Americans are preparing
to blame wakanda

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:36.119
for your attack
on their mining ship.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.247
Return my daughter
and the scientist

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:43.000
or I will inform them
of your existence.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.843
If you tell the Americans
about us,

01:22:53.344 --> 01:22:55.513
if you try to find us,

01:22:56.597 --> 01:23:00.393
or if I discover a single
wakandan ship in the ocean,

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.645
I will kill the Princess.

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:05.982
I will come to wakanda

01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:08.109
and iwill kill you.

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:18.494
So, what happened?

01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:23.374
He wants to go to war
with the surface world,

01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:25.334
and asked me to help him.

01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:31.257
I need to think.

01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:34.093
We ain't never
gettin' out of here.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:08.544
Shuri...

01:24:15.676 --> 01:24:16.802
Are you okay?

01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:18.971
Are you okay?

01:24:19.222 --> 01:24:20.502
- Give me your beads!
- Let's go.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.016
Give me your beads.
I can save her.

01:24:22.099 --> 01:24:23.100
We have to go.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:24.453
Shuri, I don't know
who this lady is,

01:24:24.477 --> 01:24:25.637
but we need to listen to her.

01:24:25.728 --> 01:24:27.039
Listen, I hit her
with a Sonic round.

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:29.315
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:31.275
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:33.778
- We have to go.
- Wait!

01:25:17.405 --> 01:25:18.406
Did they hurt you?

01:25:18.489 --> 01:25:20.116
No. No.

01:25:21.659 --> 01:25:22.868
Thank you.

01:25:26.372 --> 01:25:27.641
- Griot.
- Griot: Yes, my queen.

01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:29.709
Return us to wakanda at once.

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:29.054
Man: Princess,
it is good to have you back.

01:28:29.597 --> 01:28:31.390
The city has been on edge
since you left.

01:28:33.476 --> 01:28:36.061
Fortify the Sonic barriers
for all waterways.

01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:37.229
Princess?

01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:39.148
Neka.

01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:43.486
Thank the ancestors. Hmm?

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:47.031
I just wanted to return these.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.409
No. Keep them.

01:28:50.576 --> 01:28:52.077
Might need them soon.

01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:54.997
Did you get that
from down there?

01:28:57.958 --> 01:29:01.337
Is it true you saw
an underwater empire?

01:29:02.588 --> 01:29:04.340
- Yes.
- Aneka: Hmm.

01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:06.592
It is beautiful.

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:10.471
But these people
are dangerous, Aneka.

01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:12.014
Aneka: Mm.

01:29:30.658 --> 01:29:33.452
Ramonda: So, miss riri Williams,

01:29:34.203 --> 01:29:36.372
what do you think of wakanda?

01:29:36.539 --> 01:29:38.541
The stories just don't do
this place justice.

01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:42.711
It's great.

01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:44.630
But I really
would like to go home.

01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:47.675
You will need to be patient.

01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:49.885
Can I at least call my mom?

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:57.786
Soldier: The Princess
has been brought home

01:29:57.810 --> 01:29:59.603
by the war dog nakia.

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:01.146
Glory to hanuman.

01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:02.690
Soldiers: Glory to hanuman.

01:30:02.773 --> 01:30:07.319
Mm. The spy saves wakanda
once again.

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:09.363
The queen will reward her

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:12.032
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

01:30:14.493 --> 01:30:15.953
Okoye.

01:30:21.584 --> 01:30:23.184
Okoye: After Thanos' attack,

01:30:23.294 --> 01:30:25.421
when you left
without saying a word,

01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:27.214
it hurt.

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:34.597
I regret not being there
with all of you.

01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:37.391
It was not easy.

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:39.184
He was...

01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:43.689
King and black panther
to everyone.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:46.525
But to me...

01:30:52.281 --> 01:30:53.991
He was everything.

01:30:55.868 --> 01:30:57.828
My t'challa.

01:30:59.163 --> 01:31:02.124
When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...

01:31:02.875 --> 01:31:04.752
I had to step away

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:07.296
and let myself break.

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.175
I couldn't just...

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:15.512
Keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.

01:31:16.347 --> 01:31:18.307
Okoye: Mm-hmm.

01:31:33.322 --> 01:31:34.323
We are under attack.

01:31:42.206 --> 01:31:43.290
Here.

01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:53.693
Are you okay? Are you all right?

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:55.594
Griot, activate the sunbird.

01:31:55.761 --> 01:31:56.929
Shuri, where are you?

01:31:57.096 --> 01:31:58.555
Making my way
to the city right now.

01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:00.182
Stand down! That is an order!

01:32:00.349 --> 01:32:02.643
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:04.245
Ramonda: Aneka,
do not let her leave the lab.

01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:05.413
Mother, you're...
You're breaking up.

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:06.498
- We can't hear you.
- Ramonda: Shuri!

01:32:06.522 --> 01:32:07.523
Love you. Bye!

01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:11.058
You just hung up on the queen.

01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:12.111
I just hung up on my mom.

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:13.862
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

01:32:46.103 --> 01:32:48.188
Invaders!

01:32:53.777 --> 01:32:56.989
Mama! Mama!

01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:06.474
Griot: Emts are suffering

01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:08.292
a form of Sonic hypnosis.

01:33:12.296 --> 01:33:14.131
Ramonda:
General, plug your ears.

01:33:14.298 --> 01:33:15.382
Yes, my queen.

01:34:01.804 --> 01:34:03.931
- Can I help?
- Come, quickly.

01:34:14.525 --> 01:34:15.668
Cross your arms...

01:34:21.365 --> 01:34:22.366
Nakia.

01:34:36.755 --> 01:34:38.048
The fish man.

01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:14.167
Ayo: Phambili!

01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:27.508
Shit, he's too fast.

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:28.732
He's even faster in the water.

01:36:54.434 --> 01:36:55.995
- Activating system override.
- Shuri: No.

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:57.080
Wait! I'll fix it.

01:36:57.104 --> 01:36:59.024
Can't leave you here, shuri!

01:37:15.497 --> 01:37:16.498
Okoye: Do you see her?

01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:17.958
Yes. Right there.

01:37:31.471 --> 01:37:33.140
Go, child.

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:35.475
Wait, what? And leave you here?

01:37:35.559 --> 01:37:36.560
Run!

01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:52.701
Okoye, move now!

01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:01.520
She did this.

01:39:05.565 --> 01:39:06.733
In one week's time,

01:39:06.817 --> 01:39:09.486
I will return
with my entire army

01:39:09.653 --> 01:39:12.906
and you will join us
against the surface world,

01:39:13.073 --> 01:39:16.034
or I will wash wakanda
from the face of the earth.

01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:19.996
Mother.

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:22.165
- Keep her back!
- Mother!

01:39:22.499 --> 01:39:25.210
- Mama! Mama!
- Bury your dead.

01:39:25.961 --> 01:39:27.504
Mourn your losses.

01:39:30.841 --> 01:39:32.425
You are queen now.

01:39:32.676 --> 01:39:33.677
Mother!

01:39:38.557 --> 01:39:40.100
Get off of me! Mother!

01:39:40.851 --> 01:39:42.727
Mama!

01:39:49.568 --> 01:39:51.611
Mama!

01:39:51.695 --> 01:39:53.113
Mama!

01:39:53.697 --> 01:39:54.865
Mother!

01:40:02.414 --> 01:40:03.748
Help me!

01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:05.208
Mama!

01:40:12.716 --> 01:40:14.843
Shuri: Mama!

01:40:55.550 --> 01:41:00.722
Jabariland offers you
their comfort for your loss.

01:41:07.354 --> 01:41:09.022
You must mourn her

01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:13.109
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:16.905
Do not Bury yourself
in your technology.

01:41:17.072 --> 01:41:18.323
Why are you here?

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.910
I promised your brother

01:41:22.077 --> 01:41:24.371
that I would provide you
with counsel

01:41:24.537 --> 01:41:25.956
and protection.

01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:30.627
But I am in need
of your advice today.

01:41:34.464 --> 01:41:36.216
Your tribal elders
have approached me

01:41:36.299 --> 01:41:38.093
with a proposition.

01:41:39.511 --> 01:41:42.764
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp

01:41:42.931 --> 01:41:44.432
in jabariland.

01:41:44.599 --> 01:41:47.769
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child

01:41:48.436 --> 01:41:50.105
who scoffs at tradition?

01:41:51.106 --> 01:41:52.148
M'Baku: Mm.

01:41:54.317 --> 01:41:55.318
The world...

01:41:57.237 --> 01:41:59.906
The world has taken
too much from you

01:42:00.657 --> 01:42:03.910
for you to still be
considered a child.

01:42:07.038 --> 01:42:08.957
It is in my people's interest
to know

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.501
which way your mind is leaning.

01:42:13.378 --> 01:42:15.088
The elders are desperate.

01:42:16.715 --> 01:42:18.633
The city is vulnerable.

01:42:20.844 --> 01:42:23.013
If you are to provide for them,

01:42:24.139 --> 01:42:26.391
they will be
in great debt to you.

01:42:28.476 --> 01:42:30.186
And what of your heart?

01:42:33.732 --> 01:42:35.734
Which way is your heart leaning?

01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:40.572
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

01:42:44.075 --> 01:42:45.744
My heart was buried with her.

01:43:21.863 --> 01:43:23.740
De fontaine: Oh, man.

01:43:24.616 --> 01:43:26.534
Yeah, your olive oil's
about to go bad.

01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:27.845
What... what are you doing here?

01:43:27.869 --> 01:43:30.538
I'm hungry. And...

01:43:30.955 --> 01:43:32.957
Tragedy strikes
the international community.

01:43:33.041 --> 01:43:34.209
Sources can now confirm

01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:37.253
that queen ramonda,
daughter of lumumba, has died.

01:43:37.879 --> 01:43:39.464
Western allies say
that civil conflict

01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:41.591
was the likely cause
of the queen's...

01:43:45.512 --> 01:43:46.846
You have any comment?

01:43:49.015 --> 01:43:52.185
I wonder what else your
friends are keeping from you.

01:43:52.394 --> 01:43:54.020
What are you talking about?

01:43:54.187 --> 01:43:57.690
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of wakanda.

01:44:00.110 --> 01:44:02.278
What about the beads?

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:04.572
What?

01:44:04.739 --> 01:44:05.740
The beads.

01:44:05.907 --> 01:44:07.033
I had them bugged

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.868
before you ever even got there.

01:44:09.035 --> 01:44:12.872
I've been privy to every
conversation you've had,

01:44:12.956 --> 01:44:15.625
including that treasonous call
with the queen.

01:44:15.792 --> 01:44:17.168
May she rest in peace.

01:44:17.585 --> 01:44:18.878
But it's good.

01:44:19.045 --> 01:44:20.088
Well, for us.

01:44:20.255 --> 01:44:22.966
All right. You know what?
The wakandans saved my life.

01:44:23.466 --> 01:44:25.093
- They're a good people.
- Mm-hmm.

01:44:25.176 --> 01:44:27.220
You ever thought for a second

01:44:27.387 --> 01:44:29.013
what they could be doing?

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.598
Ever thought
what we would be doing

01:44:30.682 --> 01:44:33.893
if the us was the only country
in the world with vibranium?

01:44:34.144 --> 01:44:38.440
Oh, I actually dream about that.

01:44:41.276 --> 01:44:42.944
Val. Val, please.

01:44:43.319 --> 01:44:44.946
It's director de fontaine.

01:44:47.824 --> 01:44:50.994
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

01:44:52.287 --> 01:44:54.747
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

01:44:57.083 --> 01:44:59.461
We need to find a way
to weaken namor.

01:44:59.627 --> 01:45:01.796
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

01:45:01.963 --> 01:45:05.383
The black panther has never
failed to protect wakanda.

01:45:06.134 --> 01:45:08.136
I thought
the black panther was gone.

01:45:17.854 --> 01:45:19.189
My brother is dead.

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.526
But it doesn't mean
the black panther is gone.

01:45:41.294 --> 01:45:42.837
Griot?

01:45:43.004 --> 01:45:45.632
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis

01:45:45.798 --> 01:45:47.592
between our attempts at creating

01:45:47.675 --> 01:45:49.385
a synthetic heart-shaped herb...

01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:54.057
And the fibers
from this bracelet.

01:45:54.641 --> 01:45:55.934
Griot: Yes, Princess.

01:45:59.229 --> 01:46:01.981
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil,

01:46:03.233 --> 01:46:05.485
they may share
some base-level similarities

01:46:05.568 --> 01:46:06.694
that we can exploit.

01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:08.154
Griot: As you wish, Princess.

01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:14.869
Please upload
my brother's DNA also.

01:46:15.036 --> 01:46:16.162
Griot: Uploading now.

01:46:32.762 --> 01:46:34.889
Who do I turn to

01:46:35.515 --> 01:46:37.141
when I need saving

01:46:37.809 --> 01:46:39.978
'cause you move mountain

01:46:40.562 --> 01:46:42.397
I can't do the same

01:46:43.231 --> 01:46:44.732
and did you think about

01:46:46.442 --> 01:46:47.652
when you left us

01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:49.070
why doesn't he look like them?

01:46:49.237 --> 01:46:51.447
His physiology
is completely different.

01:46:51.614 --> 01:46:54.284
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

01:46:54.784 --> 01:46:55.844
The women that were guarding us,

01:46:55.868 --> 01:46:56.929
they had water over their mouths

01:46:56.953 --> 01:46:58.663
and on their necks.

01:46:58.746 --> 01:46:59.747
He didn't have that.

01:46:59.914 --> 01:47:02.333
Several organisms
don't need gills

01:47:02.417 --> 01:47:05.336
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

01:47:05.503 --> 01:47:07.046
It's like a jellyfish.

01:47:07.213 --> 01:47:11.009
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

01:47:12.343 --> 01:47:13.344
It's a process called

01:47:13.428 --> 01:47:14.637
- diffusion.
- Diffusion.

01:47:16.931 --> 01:47:21.436
Memories, oh, carry me go

01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:25.898
carry me go, oh, nowhere

01:47:26.357 --> 01:47:29.902
sick and tired of it all
take me far-away

01:47:29.986 --> 01:47:32.280
mr dj gbemi traba ye

01:47:32.363 --> 01:47:35.033
now I no fit trust anybody

01:47:35.116 --> 01:47:36.868
na e make I no fit shout

01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:38.870
my body Don dey tire eh

01:47:38.953 --> 01:47:41.748
every day that passes
without selecting the ruler

01:47:41.914 --> 01:47:43.291
is a day wasted.

01:47:43.458 --> 01:47:45.043
We must deal with namor

01:47:45.126 --> 01:47:46.878
before he brings
his warriors back here.

01:47:47.045 --> 01:47:49.714
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:52.390
In that attack,
before he took out your plane,

01:47:52.467 --> 01:47:53.718
he jumped back into the water.

01:47:53.885 --> 01:47:55.637
What if that's what
makes him strong?

01:47:55.803 --> 01:47:57.722
He's breathing air
and getting oxygen

01:47:57.805 --> 01:47:59.349
from the water on his skin.

01:47:59.515 --> 01:48:01.559
If we could find a way
to dry his ass out,

01:48:01.643 --> 01:48:02.769
he won't be as strong.

01:48:03.102 --> 01:48:04.354
Yo, that's it.

01:48:04.437 --> 01:48:07.649
Griot. We need to convert
the royal Talon fighter

01:48:07.732 --> 01:48:09.275
into a pervaporation chamber.

01:48:09.442 --> 01:48:10.526
Is that even possible?

01:48:10.693 --> 01:48:11.861
Yes.

01:48:13.363 --> 01:48:15.281
You're going to help us
trap him.

01:48:16.115 --> 01:48:18.117
Please show miss Williams
where she's working.

01:48:18.284 --> 01:48:19.827
Woman: Right this way.

01:48:23.665 --> 01:48:24.666
Shuri: How old were you

01:48:24.749 --> 01:48:26.167
when you built
your first machine?

01:48:26.334 --> 01:48:27.418
Riri: Three.

01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:31.047
My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.

01:48:31.214 --> 01:48:33.675
He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.

01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:39.889
So who taught you
how to do all that you do?

01:48:40.223 --> 01:48:41.474
Sh u ri: My big brother.

01:48:44.519 --> 01:48:47.855
Okoye: I was the tip of
the spear of wakanda's army.

01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:50.441
This is not me.

01:48:50.942 --> 01:48:53.111
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

01:48:54.195 --> 01:48:55.571
I turned in my weapon.

01:48:56.197 --> 01:48:57.865
I built you a new spear as well.

01:48:59.742 --> 01:49:00.743
A new one?

01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:01.953
Yes.

01:49:03.287 --> 01:49:05.665
What is this contraption's
name anyway?

01:49:05.832 --> 01:49:07.291
Shuri: The midnight angel.

01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:08.918
Midnight angel?

01:49:11.838 --> 01:49:14.048
This will even
the odds against them.

01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:16.676
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

01:49:18.511 --> 01:49:19.721
Please.

01:49:19.804 --> 01:49:22.348
My body Don dey tire eh

01:49:22.432 --> 01:49:24.225

01:49:24.308 --> 01:49:25.518
shuri.

01:49:26.185 --> 01:49:27.353
Yes.

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:30.565
How many of these did you make?

01:49:32.692 --> 01:49:34.652
Okoye: I looked for you
at the Jabari outpost.

01:49:34.819 --> 01:49:36.487
I won't be forced out
of my home.

01:49:36.654 --> 01:49:39.198
You have such
a rebellious spirit.

01:49:39.282 --> 01:49:40.742
Why did you join the dora?

01:49:41.784 --> 01:49:42.952
Why do you care?

01:49:43.244 --> 01:49:45.997
As far as I can see
na the memories

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.624
wey dey carry me from reality

01:49:48.708 --> 01:49:50.126
e no require visa

01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:52.712
I still have a lot of fight
left in me.

01:49:53.212 --> 01:49:56.340
Tell me, Aneka,
daughter of kyana,

01:49:57.008 --> 01:49:59.218
do you still have
some fight left in you?

01:49:59.385 --> 01:50:01.804
What do you have in mind?

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:05.349
My body Don dey tire eh

01:50:13.733 --> 01:50:15.777
My body Don dey tire eh

01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:18.362
make me Mara eh

01:50:18.446 --> 01:50:20.948
when my whole world
is set on fire

01:50:21.032 --> 01:50:23.826
don't leave me alone

01:50:26.454 --> 01:50:27.455
griot,

01:50:28.998 --> 01:50:30.458
what's the confidence rate?

01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:33.377
Griot: 98.7%, Princess.

01:50:33.753 --> 01:50:36.422
Would you like me to print
the heart-shaped herb?

01:50:43.721 --> 01:50:46.015
Thought
you'd be back in Haiti by now.

01:50:47.141 --> 01:50:48.684
I'm still wakandan, you know.

01:50:55.024 --> 01:50:57.985
This is what you've been up to.

01:50:58.778 --> 01:50:59.946
Yes.

01:51:00.112 --> 01:51:02.031
What you have here, now,

01:51:03.282 --> 01:51:07.495
is a chance to restore
wakanda's protector.

01:51:07.578 --> 01:51:13.000
It would be the greatest gift

01:51:13.459 --> 01:51:15.795
since bashenga's discovery.

01:51:20.925 --> 01:51:23.177
We'll soon find out. Come.

01:51:26.305 --> 01:51:27.765
- Griot?
- Griot: Yes, Princess.

01:51:27.849 --> 01:51:28.933
Shuri: Print it.

01:51:33.104 --> 01:51:34.814
Nakia: How will we know
if it works?

01:51:35.606 --> 01:51:36.858
Shuri: If it glows.

01:51:51.914 --> 01:51:53.058
I mean, shouldn't we be

01:51:53.082 --> 01:51:54.375
burning incense or something?

01:51:55.001 --> 01:51:56.085
Only bast knows

01:51:56.168 --> 01:51:58.170
how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

01:52:08.514 --> 01:52:10.349
Are you sure you don't want me
to Bury you?

01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:14.145
Need you to have access
to my chest,

01:52:14.312 --> 01:52:16.355
just in case
I go through cardiac arrest.

01:52:16.939 --> 01:52:18.482
"Cardiac arrest"?

01:52:19.567 --> 01:52:20.610
She's joking,

01:52:21.152 --> 01:52:22.403
right?

01:52:23.571 --> 01:52:25.406
Right?

01:52:30.369 --> 01:52:34.206
Allow this heart-shaped herb

01:52:34.582 --> 01:52:37.627
to give you the strength
of the black panther

01:52:38.044 --> 01:52:40.463
and take you
to the ancestral plane.

01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:00.751
Mother?

01:54:14.098 --> 01:54:15.349
N'jadaka.

01:54:15.933 --> 01:54:17.101
Lil' cousin.

01:54:17.476 --> 01:54:18.477
How?

01:54:18.561 --> 01:54:21.397
How is never as important
as why, right?

01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:24.442
You chose me.

01:54:24.608 --> 01:54:27.486
Impossible.
I would never choose you.

01:54:27.653 --> 01:54:29.321
Why did you take the herb?

01:54:30.322 --> 01:54:32.283
- To see my family.
- No, that's bullshit.

01:54:33.242 --> 01:54:35.161
You didn't believe
the ancestral plane was real,

01:54:35.244 --> 01:54:36.245
did you?

01:54:41.125 --> 01:54:42.376
So, why did you take it, then?

01:54:44.086 --> 01:54:45.463
You don't have to lie to me.

01:54:46.297 --> 01:54:47.798
So I can be strong.

01:54:48.174 --> 01:54:49.675
Strong to do what?

01:54:52.553 --> 01:54:53.554
See?

01:54:55.097 --> 01:54:57.058
We're more alike than you think.

01:54:58.976 --> 01:55:00.936
I took it to avenge
my ancestors too.

01:55:01.103 --> 01:55:02.271
I'm nothing like you.

01:55:03.731 --> 01:55:05.483
You took it for yourself,

01:55:05.649 --> 01:55:07.193
then destroyed the rest.

01:55:08.694 --> 01:55:09.904
Unworthy king,

01:55:10.738 --> 01:55:12.239
afraid of being replaced.

01:55:13.324 --> 01:55:14.325
Just a coward.

01:55:15.576 --> 01:55:16.619
I had the courage to do

01:55:16.702 --> 01:55:18.245
what was necessary
to change wakanda.

01:55:19.663 --> 01:55:21.165
How many people
like your scientist

01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:23.626
did wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

01:55:24.668 --> 01:55:25.669
Cowards.

01:55:25.836 --> 01:55:28.089
That was the panthers
that came before me,

01:55:29.173 --> 01:55:30.174
and before t'challa.

01:55:30.257 --> 01:55:32.093
Don't mention my brother.

01:55:32.426 --> 01:55:34.095
You're the reason why he's dead.

01:55:34.595 --> 01:55:37.848
You burnt the herb,
left us with no protector.

01:55:38.015 --> 01:55:40.267
Then namor struck
and killed my mother.

01:55:40.434 --> 01:55:42.269
Their blood is on your hands.

01:55:43.437 --> 01:55:44.772
That ain't on me.

01:55:45.314 --> 01:55:46.690
And don't you dare

01:55:46.857 --> 01:55:48.692
take that away from your mother.

01:55:48.859 --> 01:55:50.444
She sacrificed her life
to protect

01:55:50.528 --> 01:55:52.363
a young girl
from the lost tribe.

01:55:53.739 --> 01:55:56.408
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:59.662
He would've killed that girl.

01:56:00.371 --> 01:56:02.289
Shit, he killed his own brother.

01:56:03.874 --> 01:56:06.544
T'challa was too noble.

01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:11.048
He let the man
who murdered your father live.

01:56:13.175 --> 01:56:14.844
And here you stand.

01:56:20.516 --> 01:56:22.643
Are you gonna be noble
like your brother

01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:24.895
or take care of business...

01:56:25.604 --> 01:56:26.730
Like me?

01:56:29.567 --> 01:56:30.568
Nakia: Are you okay?

01:56:36.448 --> 01:56:37.608
Who did you see?

01:56:43.038 --> 01:56:44.039
No one.

01:56:48.919 --> 01:56:50.337
I failed.

01:56:50.504 --> 01:56:52.631
- It didn't work.
- Hey, shuri.

01:56:55.759 --> 01:56:58.137
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.763
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

01:56:59.847 --> 01:57:01.682
- I re-created the herb.
- Okay.

01:57:01.765 --> 01:57:03.809
I just did your stupid ritual,
and for what?

01:57:03.976 --> 01:57:05.519
- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?

01:57:05.603 --> 01:57:06.729
Just relax.

01:57:13.819 --> 01:57:15.112
Both: Shit.

01:57:19.450 --> 01:57:20.784
Can I get some of that too?

01:57:28.209 --> 01:57:29.251
I think...

01:57:30.794 --> 01:57:32.254
You're going to need a suit.

01:58:03.869 --> 01:58:05.931
Tribe elder 1: There are more
people coming from the city.

01:58:05.955 --> 01:58:07.581
M'Baku: They need more space.

01:58:07.748 --> 01:58:08.749
So what?

01:58:09.625 --> 01:58:11.877
You are visitors.

01:58:12.044 --> 01:58:15.256
It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.

01:58:40.406 --> 01:58:42.700
Tribe elder 2: The Princess!

01:59:16.233 --> 01:59:17.526
M'Baku: She has done it!

01:59:18.235 --> 01:59:21.238
The black panther lives!

01:59:39.089 --> 01:59:41.508
Namor believes
wakanda is on her knees.

01:59:43.969 --> 01:59:45.429
Our queen murdered.

01:59:47.931 --> 01:59:49.475
Our capital destroyed.

01:59:51.143 --> 01:59:52.978
He believes
we have no protector.

01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:55.981
But now...

01:59:57.775 --> 01:59:59.777
Now is our time to strike.

01:59:59.943 --> 02:00:03.530
Elder: How, when we don't
even know how to find him?

02:00:04.114 --> 02:00:05.824
We'll bring namor to us.

02:00:05.991 --> 02:00:07.534
- Here, again?
- Shuri: No.

02:00:07.701 --> 02:00:10.037
A distant location at sea.

02:00:10.204 --> 02:00:11.622
M'Baku: All right.

02:00:11.705 --> 02:00:13.165
Let's say this does work.

02:00:14.458 --> 02:00:17.211
Hmm. Assuming
we can kill this man

02:00:17.378 --> 02:00:20.422
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the hulk...

02:00:23.175 --> 02:00:25.594
Is murdering him
the right solution?

02:00:26.053 --> 02:00:28.013
Tribe elder 2:
You were calling for his head

02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:30.516
when his only crime
was intimidation.

02:00:30.682 --> 02:00:32.476
What has changed, lord m'Baku?

02:00:32.643 --> 02:00:33.852
His soldiers

02:00:34.019 --> 02:00:35.729
did not call him
general or king.

02:00:35.813 --> 02:00:38.482
They called him k'UK'ulkan.

02:00:38.649 --> 02:00:39.858
What is that?

02:00:40.025 --> 02:00:42.152
The feather serpent god.

02:00:42.736 --> 02:00:43.737
What?

02:00:43.821 --> 02:00:45.861
Do you think because we are
living in the mountains,

02:00:45.989 --> 02:00:47.866
we do not have access to books?

02:00:48.117 --> 02:00:49.618
Shuri: Elders,

02:00:50.035 --> 02:00:51.412
with your permission,

02:00:51.578 --> 02:00:55.290
I would like to talk
with lord m'Baku alone.

02:01:05.426 --> 02:01:06.760
Namor's not finished.

02:01:08.178 --> 02:01:11.265
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

02:01:11.432 --> 02:01:13.767
Now is our opportunity
to take him.

02:01:13.934 --> 02:01:16.186
- What are you afraid of?
- M'Baku: War.

02:01:16.603 --> 02:01:19.940
If namor is indeed
a god to his people,

02:01:20.107 --> 02:01:22.734
killing him
will risk eternal war.

02:01:22.818 --> 02:01:23.986
Shuri: And so what?

02:01:24.528 --> 02:01:26.864
Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?

02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:28.407
M'Baku: Of course it was.

02:01:29.408 --> 02:01:33.495
Of course she was.

02:01:35.497 --> 02:01:38.709
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

02:01:44.173 --> 02:01:45.883
And it is not what I want...

02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:50.262
For my people.

02:02:00.606 --> 02:02:03.650
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

02:02:04.568 --> 02:02:06.570
Of what she would've
wanted for me.

02:02:07.654 --> 02:02:09.948
Her hopes and her dreams.

02:02:13.118 --> 02:02:14.620
But she's dead.

02:02:15.662 --> 02:02:16.663
She's gone!

02:02:18.373 --> 02:02:22.252
Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!

02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:24.963
So, her dreams,

02:02:25.130 --> 02:02:28.217
her goals, her hopes for me...

02:02:31.553 --> 02:02:32.804
It doesn't exist.

02:02:35.516 --> 02:02:37.059
It doesn't matter anymore.

02:02:39.144 --> 02:02:42.022
What matters is what I want,

02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:44.900
and what I want is namor dead!

02:02:48.904 --> 02:02:50.572
And you're going
to help me get it.

02:03:06.838 --> 02:03:08.465
We leave in the morning.

02:03:34.283 --> 02:03:35.284
Nakia: Hi.

02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:36.451
Good morning.

02:03:39.079 --> 02:03:40.289
If we survive this,

02:03:41.957 --> 02:03:45.168
I want you to know you have
a home with me in Haiti.

02:03:48.005 --> 02:03:50.340
Here. Take my hands.

02:03:59.016 --> 02:04:01.518
Shuri, I want you
to be honest with me.

02:04:01.685 --> 02:04:04.730
Who did you see
when you took the herb?

02:04:09.901 --> 02:04:11.612
If you go to war for vengeance,

02:04:11.695 --> 02:04:14.197
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:16.658
It will only grow larger,

02:04:16.825 --> 02:04:18.285
and it will consume you.

02:04:20.537 --> 02:04:21.913
It already has.

02:05:51.294 --> 02:05:52.587
For the queen.

02:06:26.079 --> 02:06:27.497
Phambili!

02:07:06.661 --> 02:07:08.541
Shuri: Riri,
how's it going up there?

02:07:08.914 --> 02:07:10.194
Riri: Hey, Mr. Griot.

02:07:10.248 --> 02:07:11.848
I could really use
that backup right now.

02:07:11.875 --> 02:07:13.835
Griot: Lthought you'd never ask.

02:07:19.633 --> 02:07:20.634
Riri: Shit.

02:07:25.096 --> 02:07:26.473
Shit, he's fast.

02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:28.350
But I'm faster.

02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:35.565
Whoo!

02:07:48.328 --> 02:07:49.371
I got you.

02:07:55.710 --> 02:07:57.045
It's on you now, shuri.

02:08:06.221 --> 02:08:07.597
- Princess.
- Shuri: No.

02:08:08.098 --> 02:08:11.601
I am the black panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

02:08:12.269 --> 02:08:15.272
Griot: Pervaporation cells
activated.

02:08:24.698 --> 02:08:25.699
Shuri: What's wrong?

02:08:26.449 --> 02:08:27.742
You need a glass of water?

02:08:31.746 --> 02:08:33.456
- Yo, we got him.
- Good!

02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:34.833
Namor has been captured.

02:08:40.964 --> 02:08:42.465
Back to wakanda!

02:08:48.179 --> 02:08:49.180
Move out!

02:09:14.247 --> 02:09:16.166
What is going on?

02:09:16.249 --> 02:09:18.126
The Sonic emitter
has been destroyed.

02:09:40.357 --> 02:09:41.858
That can't be good.

02:10:13.974 --> 02:10:16.142
Griot: Panther, the
sea leopard has lost power,

02:10:16.226 --> 02:10:18.269
and they are experiencing
significant casualties.

02:10:19.813 --> 02:10:20.814
Okoye.

02:10:20.981 --> 02:10:22.232
Okoye: Panther.

02:10:22.357 --> 02:10:23.358
Phambili!

02:10:23.441 --> 02:10:24.442
Aneka.

02:10:25.694 --> 02:10:26.695
O koye!

02:10:26.778 --> 02:10:28.154
It is time.

02:10:32.742 --> 02:10:34.262
Okoye: Phambili!

02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:40.083
For wakanda!

02:10:40.792 --> 02:10:42.002
Aneka: Wakanda!

02:10:50.343 --> 02:10:51.886
Griot, what's the damage?

02:10:51.970 --> 02:10:52.971
Griot: Catastrophic.

02:10:53.054 --> 02:10:54.431
His spear is made
of raw vibranium.

02:10:54.514 --> 02:10:55.954
The ship could explode
at any second.

02:10:56.016 --> 02:10:57.017
Get us to the desert.

02:11:15.827 --> 02:11:17.120
Shuri: No!

02:12:14.552 --> 02:12:15.613
Riri: I got you, sis.

02:12:15.637 --> 02:12:16.721
Hold on.

02:14:00.909 --> 02:14:02.118
Riri: Get offme!

02:14:14.172 --> 02:14:15.381
Riri: All right, come here.

02:14:45.995 --> 02:14:47.795
M'Baku:
May the ancestors save us

02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:49.457
if the Princess does not hurry.

02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:51.251
We may be going to join them.

02:14:52.168 --> 02:14:53.253
If so, hey,

02:14:53.419 --> 02:14:55.672
let us take as many of them
with us as we can.

02:15:25.785 --> 02:15:27.203
It could've been different.

02:15:49.892 --> 02:15:51.245
Killmonger:
Are you gonna be noble

02:15:51.269 --> 02:15:52.270
like your brother

02:15:52.353 --> 02:15:53.688
or take care of business

02:15:53.855 --> 02:15:54.897
like me?

02:15:55.064 --> 02:15:56.607
I'm not my brother.

02:15:58.026 --> 02:16:00.028
Namorwill beg me for mercy

02:16:00.695 --> 02:16:03.239
as I stand and watch as he dies.

02:16:46.699 --> 02:16:48.659
Wakanda forever!

02:18:37.058 --> 02:18:38.561
Ramonda: Shuri.

02:18:40.103 --> 02:18:41.105
Shuri: Mama.

02:18:44.066 --> 02:18:45.359
Show him

02:18:45.735 --> 02:18:47.278
who you are.

02:18:54.118 --> 02:18:55.119
Yield,

02:18:56.329 --> 02:18:58.664
and wakanda
will protect your oceans.

02:18:58.831 --> 02:19:01.083
We will protect your secrets.

02:19:01.250 --> 02:19:02.251
Yield,

02:19:03.503 --> 02:19:05.213
and your people will live.

02:19:09.299 --> 02:19:11.636
Vengeance has consumed us.

02:19:12.093 --> 02:19:14.722
We cannot let it
consume our people.

02:20:10.736 --> 02:20:12.613
Wakanda forever!

02:20:13.072 --> 02:20:14.657
Wakandans: Wakanda forever!

02:20:38.889 --> 02:20:40.516
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

02:20:43.894 --> 02:20:46.105
oou le le -

02:20:50.067 --> 02:20:52.695
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

02:20:52.778 --> 02:20:57.199
oou oou
le le oou le le oou le oou le

02:20:57.283 --> 02:20:58.951
well, I pray that the universe

02:20:59.035 --> 02:21:00.536
thank you, my love.

02:21:02.246 --> 02:21:04.915
Gives you way more
than you deserve

02:21:07.001 --> 02:21:09.587
when the tears fall
like shooting stars

02:21:10.004 --> 02:21:11.839
remember who you are

02:21:12.548 --> 02:21:16.385
just look up to the sky
you'll see

02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:19.263
well, I pray that the universe

02:21:21.432 --> 02:21:24.268
gives you way more
than you deserve

02:21:24.352 --> 02:21:25.519
shuri: Yo.

02:21:29.023 --> 02:21:31.150
All set to head home?

02:21:31.233 --> 02:21:32.377
As long as you're sure
the police

02:21:32.401 --> 02:21:33.921
won't be waiting for me
at the airport.

02:21:34.028 --> 02:21:35.655
Don't worry. Took care of that.

02:21:35.821 --> 02:21:37.114
But you might want to slow down

02:21:37.198 --> 02:21:39.450
on your
homework-for-hire business.

02:21:39.533 --> 02:21:41.911
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

02:21:43.204 --> 02:21:45.182
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

02:21:45.206 --> 02:21:46.207
Yes.

02:21:46.540 --> 02:21:49.752
Your suit. It's a great design,

02:21:50.294 --> 02:21:51.574
but can't let you leave with it.

02:21:51.712 --> 02:21:52.922
It's all good.

02:21:53.005 --> 02:21:54.298
Figured the least I could do

02:21:54.382 --> 02:21:56.050
is help wakanda
clean up my mess.

02:21:57.301 --> 02:21:58.803
I have one more thing
to show you.

02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:00.221
Come.

02:22:04.225 --> 02:22:07.311
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river,

02:22:07.478 --> 02:22:08.854
but it was worth it.

02:22:09.522 --> 02:22:10.523
Riri: How did you...

02:22:11.857 --> 02:22:13.401
It's my dad's car.

02:22:14.652 --> 02:22:16.362
We used to work on it before...

02:22:16.445 --> 02:22:19.031
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

02:22:19.115 --> 02:22:21.200
I'm coming back for you

02:22:22.326 --> 02:22:24.203
- you sure this is her?
- Every part.

02:22:24.370 --> 02:22:25.830
Have it shipped to Boston.

02:22:25.996 --> 02:22:27.289
Be there before you arrive.

02:22:32.837 --> 02:22:33.838
Bring it in, man.

02:22:37.425 --> 02:22:41.721
Griot: Panther, miss Williams'
transport has arrived.

02:22:42.346 --> 02:22:43.889
Look after yourself.

02:22:44.223 --> 02:22:46.642
Sure you're not trying
to slide to Chicago?

02:22:46.809 --> 02:22:47.893
Catch a bulls game?

02:22:49.145 --> 02:22:50.688
Sounds fun,

02:22:50.771 --> 02:22:53.607
but I have something
I need to take care of.

02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:20.801
And now I present to you

02:23:20.968 --> 02:23:22.136
Princess shuri,

02:23:22.303 --> 02:23:23.596
the black panther!

02:23:42.072 --> 02:23:44.909
The black panther
sends her regards,

02:23:45.701 --> 02:23:47.703
but she will not be
joining us today.

02:23:48.829 --> 02:23:50.790
I, m'Baku,

02:23:50.956 --> 02:23:53.501
leader of the Jabari tribe,

02:23:53.667 --> 02:23:55.127
son of wakanda,

02:23:56.629 --> 02:23:58.380
wish to challenge

02:23:59.465 --> 02:24:00.633
for the throne.

02:25:32.433 --> 02:25:33.827
Agent 1: What the hell is this?

02:25:33.851 --> 02:25:36.270
Agent 2: Can we turn around?

02:25:36.687 --> 02:25:38.647
Agent 1: I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

02:25:40.065 --> 02:25:41.483
Why don't you go check it out?

02:25:41.567 --> 02:25:42.860
Agent 2: Okay.

02:25:45.654 --> 02:25:46.947
Agent 1: Yeah, this is shauver.

02:25:47.364 --> 02:25:49.366
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

02:25:49.533 --> 02:25:51.243
How do you want us to proceed?

02:25:51.327 --> 02:25:52.786
What the...

02:26:03.422 --> 02:26:04.715
Ah!

02:26:04.798 --> 02:26:07.134
A colonizer in chains.

02:26:07.801 --> 02:26:09.845
Now I have seen everything.

02:26:09.929 --> 02:26:11.055
Funny.

02:26:35.788 --> 02:26:36.789
Shuri: Merci.

02:26:46.715 --> 02:26:47.716
Shuri: Hey.

02:26:52.388 --> 02:26:53.806
It's good to see you.

02:26:54.556 --> 02:26:55.766
Everything is ready.

02:26:55.933 --> 02:26:57.309
Just give me one moment, eh?

02:26:57.476 --> 02:26:58.811
Actually,

02:26:58.978 --> 02:27:00.854
I think I should do it
on my own.

02:27:02.064 --> 02:27:03.440
Of course.

02:28:56.637 --> 02:29:00.057
Lift me up

02:29:02.017 --> 02:29:05.437
hold me down

02:29:07.397 --> 02:29:11.610
keep me close

02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:16.198
safe and sound

02:29:18.283 --> 02:29:23.038
burning in a hopeless dream

02:29:23.539 --> 02:29:29.002
hold me when you go to sleep

02:29:29.086 --> 02:29:32.673
keep me in the warmth
of your love

02:29:32.756 --> 02:29:35.926
when you depart keep me safe

02:29:36.009 --> 02:29:38.137
safe and sound

02:29:39.888 --> 02:29:43.225
lift me up

02:29:45.185 --> 02:29:48.939
hold me down

02:29:50.607 --> 02:29:54.528
keep me close

02:29:56.029 --> 02:29:59.408
safe and sound

02:30:01.368 --> 02:30:06.290
drowning in an endless sea

02:30:06.623 --> 02:30:11.837
take some time and stay with me

02:30:12.171 --> 02:30:16.508
keep me in the strength
of your arms

02:30:16.592 --> 02:30:19.178
keep me safe

02:30:19.261 --> 02:30:21.430

lift me up

02:30:28.562 --> 02:30:32.274

02:30:33.817 --> 02:30:37.988
keep me safe

02:30:39.114 --> 02:30:42.284
safe and sound

02:30:44.661 --> 02:30:49.958
burning in a hopeless dream

02:30:50.042 --> 02:30:55.172
hold me when you go to sleep

02:30:55.255 --> 02:30:59.384

02:30:59.468 --> 02:31:04.306

02:31:06.308 --> 02:31:09.436
-lift me up -lift me up

02:31:09.519 --> 02:31:11.772

-hold me down

02:31:15.067 --> 02:31:17.152

-keep me safe -hold me

02:31:22.282 --> 02:31:25.786
we need light we need love

02:31:38.465 --> 02:31:39.466
Nakia: Shuri,

02:31:40.801 --> 02:31:42.511
can we join you now?

02:31:45.597 --> 02:31:48.642
This is my son, toussaint.

02:31:49.810 --> 02:31:50.811
Toussaint,

02:31:51.478 --> 02:31:54.606
this is your aunty, shuri.

02:32:17.963 --> 02:32:20.632
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

02:32:20.799 --> 02:32:23.885
Away from the pressure
of the throne.

02:32:25.262 --> 02:32:26.471
Your father,

02:32:27.097 --> 02:32:28.849
your baba,

02:32:29.016 --> 02:32:31.685
prepared us for his death,
didn't he?

02:32:36.356 --> 02:32:38.400
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral

02:32:39.234 --> 02:32:42.154
because he felt the time
was not yet right.

02:32:42.863 --> 02:32:45.657
So we had our own ceremony
for him here.

02:32:47.409 --> 02:32:48.994
Did my mother meet him?

02:32:49.077 --> 02:32:50.078
Nakia: She did.

02:32:59.671 --> 02:33:00.797
It's nice to meet you.

02:33:00.881 --> 02:33:02.174
Nice to meet you.

02:33:02.341 --> 02:33:03.884
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

02:33:04.384 --> 02:33:06.511
It holds a great history.

02:33:06.678 --> 02:33:09.973
Thanks. Yours is cool, too,
I guess.

02:33:13.268 --> 02:33:15.437
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:16.521
Is that true?

02:33:17.773 --> 02:33:20.567
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:25.864
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

02:33:30.911 --> 02:33:33.121
My name is prince t'challa,

02:33:33.205 --> 02:33:35.123
son of king t'challa.

02:35:02.377 --> 02:35:08.091
I give my heart to this place

02:35:10.427 --> 02:35:16.808
I give my soul or whatever it takes

02:35:16.892 --> 02:35:18.977
never run away

02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:25.233
I've got enough angels to storm the gates

02:35:25.317 --> 02:35:27.319
I'm not afraid

02:35:27.402 --> 02:35:31.448
behold the brave

02:35:31.531 --> 02:35:35.327
and I'll have it, no other way

02:35:35.410 --> 02:35:41.374
I missed the emergence
and these moments of you

02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:45.462
the mere reflection of me

02:35:45.545 --> 02:35:49.382
that mirror can't change its view

02:35:49.466 --> 02:35:52.302
so until those rivers run out

02:35:52.385 --> 02:35:57.933
it runs through me wherever you are

02:35:58.016 --> 02:35:59.851
I'll be there

02:36:01.102 --> 02:36:04.272
we carry on

02:36:06.483 --> 02:36:07.984
born again

02:36:08.068 --> 02:36:12.322
I give my heart to this place

02:36:12.405 --> 02:36:15.784
I give my heart to this place

02:36:15.867 --> 02:36:22.165
I give my whole soul and whatever it takes

02:36:22.541 --> 02:36:24.167
never run away

02:36:24.292 --> 02:36:27.295
and I'd relive this

02:36:27.379 --> 02:36:32.509
just to see your face again

02:36:32.592 --> 02:36:38.139
I know that you'll do the same

02:36:39.266 --> 02:36:40.767
born again

02:36:40.850 --> 02:36:46.106
just tell me what I need to do

02:36:48.984 --> 02:36:54.489
I'd die and come back
just to love you

02:36:57.242 --> 02:37:03.915
just tell me I'm begging you

02:37:05.458 --> 02:37:11.298
just tell me what I need to do
