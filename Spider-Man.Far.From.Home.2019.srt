1
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,288
Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.

2
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:18,735
What, are we fighting the weather now?

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,572
Locals say the cyclone had a face.

4
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,001
People see things
when they're under stress.

5
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,319
That does not mean that
this is the start to some other...

6
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,491
big world-ending...

7
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,344
Who are you?

8
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,309
You don't want any part of this.

9
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,632
<i>Gone but not forgotten.</i>

10
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,805
<i>Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy</i>

11
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,928
<i>for their help
with that touching video tribute.</i>

12
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,254
<i>This year has been
nothing short of...</i>

13
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:08,367
<i>♪♪♪♪ is crazy.</i>

14
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:09,732
<i>It's insane.</i>

15
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:10,690
<i>Jason.
What?</i>

16
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,561
<i>No swearing.</i>

17
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,808
<i>It's the last day of school. We're good.</i>

18
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,986
<i>Historic.</i>

19
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:19,412
<i>Over five years ago,
half of all life in the universe,</i>

20
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:23,173
<i>including our own Midtown High,
was wiped from existence.</i>

21
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,529
<i>But then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes,</i>

22
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,531
<i>brought us back.</i>

23
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,580
<i>They called it the Blip.</i>

24
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,338
<i>Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age,</i>

25
00:03:34,537 --> 00:03:38,621
<i>But our classmates that didn't Blip
had grown five years older.</i>

26
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,396
<i>My little brother is
now older than me.</i>

27
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:42,648
<i>Yeah, it's math.</i>

28
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:46,136
<i>And even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year</i>

29
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,434
<i>and had already taken midterms,</i>

30
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,183
<i>the school made us start the whole year
over from the beginning.</i>

31
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:52,510
<i>It's totally unfair.</i>

32
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,885
<i>It's not right.</i>

33
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,034
<i>Tigers,</i>

34
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,368
<i>it's been a long, dramatic,</i>

35
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,283
<i>somewhat confusing road.</i>

36
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,690
<i>As we draw this year to a close,</i>

37
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,991
<i>it's time to move on.</i>

38
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,126
<i>To a new phase of our lives.</i>

39
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:08,308
<i>Pray nothing crazy happens again</i>

40
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,184
<i>because are the Avengers even
a thing anymore?</i>

41
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,722
<i>Does anyone even have a plan?</i>

42
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,355
I have a plan.

43
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,987
Ok, first, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

44
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,398
Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual-headphone adapter,

45
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,357
and watch movies with her
the whole time.

46
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:21,054
Ok.

47
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,594
Three, when we go to Venice.

48
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,857
Venice is famous for making stuff
out of glass, right?

49
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:26,047
True.
So I'm gonna buy her,

50
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,889
a black dahlia necklace because
her favorite flower is the black dahlia...

51
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,602
because of, well...
The murder.

52
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,777
The murder.
Four, when we go to Paris,

53
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,627
I'm gonna take her to the top
of the Eiffel Tower,

54
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:35,997
give her the necklace.

55
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:38,332
Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

56
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:41,699
And then six,
hopefully she tells me,

57
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:42,797
she feels the same way.

58
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:44,400
Don't forget step seven.

59
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,564
Step seven?

60
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:46,495
Don't do any of that.

61
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:48,625
Why?

62
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,982
Because we're gonna be
bachelors in Europe, Peter.

63
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:51,861
Ned.
Look.

64
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:53,803
I may not know much
but I do know this.

65
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,619
Europeans love Americans.

66
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,504
Really?
And, more than half of them are women.

67
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,173
Ok. Sure.

68
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:01,762
But...

69
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:04,260
I really like MJ, man, ok?

70
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,283
She's awesome,

71
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:07,196
she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

72
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:08,845
And sometimes I catch her
looking at me,

73
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:09,762
I feel like I've stood up...

74
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,230
Wait. She's coming.
Just don't say anything.

75
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:12,063
What up, dorks?

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,512
Excited about the science trip?

77
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,953
Hey, yeah, we're just
talking about the trip.

78
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:17,111
Yeah, and Peter's plan.

79
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:18,316
You have a plan?

80
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,785
I don't...

81
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:21,480
I don't have a plan.

82
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,211
No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons
when we're traveling to other countries.

83
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:27,678
Like... like a grandmother?

84
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,064
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.

85
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:32,810
Ok, well...

86
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,800
that was a real roller coaster.

87
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:37,655
By the way, travel tip.

88
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:39,752
You should probably download a VPN
on your phone,

89
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:42,087
just so the government
can't track you while we're abroad.

90
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,102
Smart.

91
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:44,713
Will do.

92
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,763
Dude, I think that went really great.

93
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:57,528
<i>When, when I Blipped back
to my apartment,</i>

94
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,085
<i>the family that was living there
was very confused.</i>

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,798
<i>The wife thought that
I was a mistress.</i>

96
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,385
<i>The grandma thought
that I was a ghost.</i>

97
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:07,106
<i>It was... It was really a mess.</i>

98
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,063
<i>Thank you all for coming out</i>

99
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,527
<i>to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.</i>

100
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,105
<i>And of course,
thanks to our very own,</i>

101
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:15,668
<i>Spider-Man!</i>

102
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,366
<i>Thank you Miss Parker,
for having me.</i>

103
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:31,922
<i>And thank you, you guys,
for having me.</i>

104
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:35,898
<i>And thank you, Spider-Man.</i>

105
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,214
<i>He'll be right back out
to take photos and...</i>

106
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:39,661
<i>videos. Thank you!</i>

107
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,392
That was amazing.
That was great.

108
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,317
That was so cool.
I was so nervous.

109
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:51,163
Sorry, I was a little stiff.
I felt like I wasn't in the pocket.

110
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,130
No, I thought you did great.

111
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:54,222
Yeah, I actually thought
you were a little stiff.

112
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:56,743
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.

113
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,168
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Ok.

114
00:06:58,557 --> 00:06:59,792
Did you get your passport?
Yeah.

115
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,074
Mini toothpaste?
Yeah, I did.

116
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,216
Hey, sorry I'm late.

117
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:06,444
Happy. Hey.

118
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:07,547
You look lovely.

119
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,704
Thanks. You too.

120
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:09,594
Thank you.

121
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:11,911
New dress?
Yeah, yes, it is.

122
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,971
It's a new beard.

123
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,100
It's my... My Blip beard.

124
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,847
I grew it in the Blip.

125
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,636
It's a Blip beard.

126
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:20,091
I see. Yeah.

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,603
Yeah, anyway, so...

128
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:23,508
the reason I'm late is because
this was misplaced at the office.

129
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,062
Can you believe it?
Because it's enormous.

130
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,445
I mean not the amount, the size.

131
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:27,759
So the amount's nice, too.

132
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,267
They're very generous.
Pepper Potts said,

133
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:31,810
sorry she couldn't be here.
Yeah. Thank you.

134
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,085
I think I'm gonna go change the...

135
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:36,126
Sterno under the vegan lasagne.

136
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:38,385
Spider-Man,

137
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:39,445
go shake hands.

138
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:40,512
Will do.

139
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:46,799
What just happened?

140
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,247
Heads up,

141
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:49,866
Nick Fury's calling you.

142
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,517
Nick Fury's gonna call me?
Yeah.

143
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:52,101
Why?

144
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:54,862
Why? Because he probably
has some hero stuff for you to do.

145
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,016
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

146
00:07:57,065 --> 00:08:00,263
Well I mean, if it was that important,
he'd probably call someone else, not me.

147
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,559
Apparently not.

148
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:08,453
No caller ID. That's him.

149
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,779
I don't really wanna talk to Fury.

150
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,813
Answer the phone.
Why?

151
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,248
Because if you don't talk to him,
than I have to talk and I don't want to him.

152
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,530
But why don't you want to talk to him?
Because I'm scared. Just answer the phone.

153
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,862
You sent Nick Fury to voicemail?
Yeah.

154
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,071
You don't send Fury to voicemail.

155
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:21,423
Did you hear that?
They're calling me.

156
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,377
It's.. I got to go. I got to go.
You got to talk to him.

157
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:26,190
I'm gonna call him. I promise you,
I'm gonna call him. I will.

158
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,964
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

159
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,753
I promise you, I'll call him.

160
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,565
After my trip.

161
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,275
Hey!

162
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,051
Yeah, hi...

163
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:37,865
No, no, he's not ghosting you.

164
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,678
Ok. Ok, one question at a time.

165
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,342
Are you the head Avenger?
Are you the head Avenger now?

166
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:46,722
No, I'm not.

167
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:48,886
If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

168
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,667
If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

169
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,980
Does anyone have
any neighborhood questions?

170
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,625
Sean Winford, Queens Tribune.

171
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:57,566
What it is like to take over
for Tony Stark?

172
00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,212
Those are some big shoes to fill.

173
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:03,623
I'm...

174
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,429
I'm gonna go. Thanks so much,
everyone for coming.

175
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:47,942
Ok.

176
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,177
Hungry?

177
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:58,564
So sorry.

178
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:01,267
I thought you could sense that with your...

179
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:02,384
Peter-tingle.

180
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,810
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

181
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:05,888
So what's up?

182
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,935
You can dodge bullets but not bananas?

183
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,056
No, I just really need this vacation.

184
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:11,184
I need a break.

185
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:13,784
You deserve it.

186
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:17,117
Yeah.

187
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:18,988
You know what?

188
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,889
You should pack your suit,
just in case.

189
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,289
I have a tingle about it.

190
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,209
Please stop saying tingle, May.

191
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,872
No.

192
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,969
No. No, I'm not.

193
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,417
Awasome.
Yeah!

194
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:54,639
Do you want the first shift
or the second? I could take either.

195
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,066
Give me the third shift.
I took an Ambien.

196
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:58,938
I can't chaperone these kids alone.

197
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,992
Yo, Parker.

198
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:03,116
This is called an airplane.
It's like the buses you're used to,

199
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,555
except it flies over the poor neighborhoods
instead of driving through them.

200
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:07,586
Ma'am?

201
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:11,748
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

202
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:12,978
I'll take that.

203
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:15,795
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

204
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,713
Classic MJ, right?

205
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,598
Did you know Brad was coming?

206
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,179
It... It's so weird.

207
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:29,601
One day, he's that little kid who cried
and got nosebleeds all the time,

208
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:31,272
and suddenly, we Blip back,

209
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:33,820
and he's totally
ripped and super nice

210
00:11:33,822 --> 00:11:35,004
and all these girls are after him.

211
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,403
Not all the girls are after him.
No, man, they're all after him.

212
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,480
Yeah. Here.

213
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:42,529
Anyway, on to more important things.

214
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,992
It's a nine-hour flight.

215
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,705
We can play Beast Slayers
the whole time.

216
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,450
Are you excited?

217
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,165
I need your help to sit next to MJ.

218
00:11:52,063 --> 00:11:54,071
Seriously?
Yes, seriously.

219
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:57,099
What about our plan?
American bachelors in Europe.

220
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,889
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.
Come on, this is my plan.

221
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:04,145
Please.

222
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:09,347
Hey, guys.

223
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:14,231
There's an old lady in front of us
wearing a crazy amount of perfume,

224
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,788
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

225
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,052
You know Betty, if you could just...

226
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,866
switch seats with him that would be...

227
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,139
He's allergic to perfume?

228
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:25,972
Yeah, yeah, because...

229
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,736
It makes his eyes water,

230
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:30,118
and he can't really...
You said Peter has a perfume allergy?

231
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,814
I'll tell you from experience,
perfume allergies are no joke.

232
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:35,668
I can feel hives breaking out already.

233
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:36,968
MJ, stand up.

234
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:40,397
Ned, take MJ's spot.
MJ, you take my spot.

235
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,584
Peter, come with me.
Let's get you out of there.

236
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,293
Sorry.
Zach and Sebastian,

237
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,032
you take Ned and Peter's seats.
That's alright.

238
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,092
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

239
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,670
Your safety is my responsibility.
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

240
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:55,626
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!

241
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,150
Let's go!

242
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:04,810
Yeah,

243
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:07,459
I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

244
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:13,036
So did you want to play Beast Slayer?

245
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:13,918
Nope.

246
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:17,512
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or...?

247
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:17,930
No.
Got it.

248
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:22,347
Did I tell you how my wife
pretended to Blip out?

249
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,921
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

250
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,180
We had a fake funeral
for her and everything.

251
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,465
Well, the funeral was real...

252
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,416
because I thought she was really dead.

253
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,472
Did you wanna see the video?

254
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,219
I got a dual-headphone adapter
if you want to watch a movie.

255
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,898
Only if it's depressing.

256
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,013
Or hilarious.

257
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,712
You have a dual-headphone adapter.

258
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,423
We can watch together.

259
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,605
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

260
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:48,701
<i>Our flight time today will be eight hours
and 49 minutes to Venice, Italy.</i>

261
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,304
Hey man, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

262
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:00,309
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

263
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:02,157
Dude, don't worry, ok?

264
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,947
I'm sure that's nothing.
Hey, babe.

265
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,725
Can you hold this for me, please?

266
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,468
Yeah, of course.
Thanks.

267
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,165
What was that?

268
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:18,990
Well,

269
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:21,611
we actually got to talking
on the plane, and it turns out,

270
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:23,139
we have a lot in common.

271
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:25,479
So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

272
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:28,626
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

273
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:29,464
Peter,

274
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,168
those were the words of a boy.

275
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,972
And that boy met a woman.

276
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,937
A very strong and powerful woman.

277
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,893
And now...

278
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:39,455
that boy is a man.

279
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,430
Babe?
Coming, babe.

280
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,112
There's nothing in there. I swear.

281
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:06,825
These, no.

282
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,511
Sorry.

283
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,598
I'm here. Mr. Harrington.
Wait, wait, wait.

284
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,645
I'm here, I'm here.
Thank goodness.

285
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,791
Looks like we're here.

286
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:00,340
They're doing some
renovations to the place.

287
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,420
Getting some upgrades.

288
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:02,937
This is trash.

289
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,520
That must be the concierge.
Ok.

290
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:05,547
Come on, man.

291
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:07,323
Everyone,

292
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:09,146
here we are.

293
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,481
Tell me we're not staying here.
Come on in.

294
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,062
This place is sinking.

295
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:16,353
I think you mean, charming.
It stinks.

296
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,488
Ok, everybody,

297
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:18,915
drop your bags off.

298
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,369
We're gonna meet
at the da Vinci Museum at 3.

299
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,162
Let's go!

300
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:23,790
¡Vamonos!
It's andiamo.

301
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,205
Andiamo!
There you go.

302
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,751
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

303
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:28,794
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

304
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:35,836
What's up, Flash Mob?

305
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:36,959
How you guys doing?

306
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:38,728
I'm here in St. Marco Polo's...

307
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:42,450
This is so much fun.
Yeah?

308
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:08,014
Three, two, one.
Say pizza.

309
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,938
Pizza!
Pizza time!

310
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:30,848
Buongiorno.
Buongiorno

311
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:32,176
Hi.

312
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:34,705
I'm looking for a...

313
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:36,144
Black flower.

314
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,850
It's perfect.

315
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:55,848
Boh!

316
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,772
What?

317
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:58,814
Boh.

318
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:00,205
The most perfect word in the world.

319
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,848
Italians created it,
and I just discovered it.

320
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,779
What does it mean?

321
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:04,292
That's the thing,
it can mean a million things.

322
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,808
It could mean,
I don't know. Get out of my face.

323
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,415
I don't know and Get out of my face.

324
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,355
It's the best thing Italy created,
except for maybe espresso.

325
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:12,741
So you've been drinking espresso.

326
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:13,530
American.

327
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,827
Hey. German? American.

328
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:17,513
A rose for you.
Boh.

329
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:22,150
Boh is my new superpower.

330
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,482
It's like the anti-aloha.

331
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,828
I was born to say this word.

332
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,210
So, what's in the bag?

333
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:30,376
Boh.

334
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,171
Nice.

335
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:41,620
Cool.

336
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,364
What was that?

337
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,421
Betty! You ok?
Yeah.

338
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,580
Oh my God!
Come on.

339
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,421
Guys, we got to go!

340
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,647
What is that?
I don't know.

341
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,687
What are you gonna do?
I left my suit in the hotel room.

342
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,366
Why?
Because I'm on vacation, Ned!

343
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,452
Everyone's gonna see my face.
Just get them out of here.

344
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:40,601
Go!
Just go!

345
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,546
Ned go!

346
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,539
Oh my God.

347
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,763
Come on.

348
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:19,185
No, you don't.

349
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,696
You ok?

350
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:31,874
Get out of here. Go!

351
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:24,402
Excuse me, sir!

352
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:25,998
I... I can help. Let me help.

353
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:27,863
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

354
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:29,813
I need to lead it away from the canals.

355
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:57,097
The da Vinci Museum.

356
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,990
This is why we're
here in Venice.

357
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,110
This is it.

358
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,506
It's closed.

359
00:23:01,928 --> 00:23:03,702
What do you mean it's closed?
Till when?

360
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,572
November.

361
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,376
You didn't check the website?

362
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:07,793
That's a good idea.

363
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,983
Come on.

364
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,066
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

365
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,334
Who is that guy?

366
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,464
I don't know,
but he's kicking that water's ass.

367
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,911
Yeah! Yeah!

368
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,348
It's aliens. It has to be.

369
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:25,602
BuzzFeed says there is a sailor
named Morris Bench

370
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:28,168
who was exposed to an experimental
underwater generator

371
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,394
and got hydro powers.

372
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:32,403
Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the Internet.

373
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:35,159
Spider-Man could take him.
What do you think it is?

374
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,114
You know, being a man of science...

375
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,225
witches.

376
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,596
No, no, no. We wanna stay.
We wanna stay.

377
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,219
It's a good thing I packed your suit?

378
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:46,811
<i>I can't believe you forgot it.</i>

379
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:47,914
Yeah.

380
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:51,198
So who was that guy that you were with?
Was that Mr. Strange?

381
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:53,891
Doctor Strange, May.
Doctor Strange.

382
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:55,933
And no, I don't know who that was.

383
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:56,924
<i>It was a new guy.</i>

384
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,293
I was trying to help him but...
<i>Hey Happy!</i>

385
00:25:58,624 --> 00:25:59,628
That's my lunch.

386
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,427
Don't eat that one.

387
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,471
Happy's there?

388
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,154
Yeah, it's Happy.

389
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,009
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

390
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:08,060
<i>And he's hanging around the office.</i>

391
00:26:08,188 --> 00:26:09,252
And he wants to say hi.

392
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:10,740
I don't want... Hi, Peter.

393
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,109
Hey, Happy.

394
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:16,845
Sorry, I'm working real hard here.
I got to do a... A leaflet drop.

395
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,231
What are you doing?
<i>Glad you're having a good time.</i>

396
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:22,056
Don't worry,
I'm really taking care of your aunt.

397
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,165
So...

398
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,794
<i>how's the plan going?</i>

399
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,625
There's been setbacks, for sure.

400
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:34,299
Don't over-think it. It's just trust
your instincts and you'll be fine.

401
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:35,425
<i>I know. Love you.</i>

402
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,396
Bye.

403
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:39,842
Who is that guy?

404
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:42,176
He's like Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

405
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,635
He's alright. He's no Spider-Man.

406
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,854
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

407
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:49,686
What? He's just awesome, ok?

408
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:53,151
He protects the neighborhood
and you know, he's inspiring.

409
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,798
He inspires me to be a better man.

410
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,629
What's up, dickwad?

411
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,807
Thought you drowned.

412
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:02,749
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

413
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:06,702
L'uomo Del misterio is Italian
for man of mystery.

414
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:08,392
They don't actually know who he is.

415
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:09,816
Mysterio.

416
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,295
Cool name.
Cool name.

417
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:14,882
Babe.
Babe.

418
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,842
So how much of that
did you actually see?

419
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:18,968
Not much. I was running.

420
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:20,112
Right. Me too.

421
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:21,531
I was also running...

422
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:23,083
away.

423
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,343
So Paris tomorrow.

424
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,584
Go to the Eiffel Tower.

425
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:30,284
Should be great.

426
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:33,053
Yeah, I read it was secretly built
as a mind-control antenna

427
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,671
to create an army of the insane.

428
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,302
Which is why it's my favorite
destination on the whole trip.

429
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,450
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

430
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:45,098
Nothing.

431
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:45,970
It's dead.

432
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:47,942
And besides, that
Mysterio guy's all over it.

433
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,040
Look, I just wanna
spend some time with MJ.

434
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,439
We were talking about Paris and...

435
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:53,207
I think she really likes me.

436
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
That's nice.

437
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:56,543
Reminds me of when Betty
and I first fell in love.

438
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:58,680
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler right and...

439
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:07,199
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

440
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,100
You're Nick Fury.

441
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:14,315
And you just shot Ned.

442
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:16,956
It's just a mild tranquilizer.
He'll be alright.

443
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,836
So good to finally meet you.

444
00:28:20,508 --> 00:28:21,780
I saw you at the funeral,

445
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:24,320
but I didn't think that was a good time
to exchange numbers.

446
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,451
No, that would have been
really inappropriate.

447
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,575
That's what I just said.
Right.

448
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,144
The important thing is, you're here.

449
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:32,673
I tried to bring you here.

450
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:35,503
You avoided me and now you're here.

451
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,044
What a coincidence.

452
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,654
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

453
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,600
I used to know everything.

454
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,251
Then I come back five years later,
and now I know nothing.

455
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:49,038
No intel, no team.

456
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,770
And a high school kid

457
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,145
is dodging my calls.

458
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:56,443
Here's what I do know.

459
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,184
A week ago,

460
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,009
a village in Mexico,

461
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:04,005
was wiped out by a cyclone.

462
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,785
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

463
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,377
Three days later,

464
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,640
a similar event in Morocco.

465
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:17,485
A village was...

466
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,207
Just making the rounds.

467
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,759
See if anyone needs any emotional
counseling after today's traumatic events.

468
00:29:24,018 --> 00:29:26,383
No, we'll be ok.
We're fine. Thank you.

469
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,530
Great because I'm...
I'm not qualified...

470
00:29:29,123 --> 00:29:30,308
to actually...

471
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,346
he's passed out.

472
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:34,600
I'm not qualified to do it anyway,
so good night.

473
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:37,404
That was my teacher.

474
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:39,693
Sorry about that.
You were saying?

475
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,145
A village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening...

476
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:46,191
Babe, you still awake?
You're not answering any of my texts.

477
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:47,992
He's asleep, Betty.

478
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:49,678
Already?

479
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,409
Yeah.
Ok.

480
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:53,499
That's why it's imperative...

481
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:57,711
Hey, boys. So that canal water today
was filled with dangerous bacteria...

482
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,540
Another person touches that door,
you and I are going to attend another funeral.

483
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,671
Suit up.
Let me know if you develop vomiting.

484
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:10,340
Stark left these for you.

485
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,851
Really?

486
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,443
An uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.

487
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:31,279
Stark said you would not get that
because it's not a Star Wars reference.

488
00:30:36,363 --> 00:30:38,705
You can lose the mask.
Everyone here has seen you without it.

489
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,651
You'd be feigning anonymity

490
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:42,894
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

491
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,305
Come on.

492
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,390
Yeah.

493
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:57,364
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

494
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,916
That is Dimitri.

495
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,216
And this,

496
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:05,418
is Mr. Beck.

497
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,491
Mysterio?

498
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,857
What?

499
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,016
Doesn't matter.

500
00:31:12,018 --> 00:31:13,871
It's just what my friends
have been calling you.

501
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:14,983
Well,

502
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:16,485
you can call me Quentin.

503
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,753
You handled yourself
well out there today.

504
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,255
I saw what you did with the tower.

505
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,252
We could use someone like you
on my world.

506
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:26,408
Thanks.

507
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:28,457
I'm sorry. Your world?

508
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,128
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

509
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,967
Just not yours.

510
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:34,804
There are multiple realities, Peter.

511
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,156
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

512
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,180
I'm sorry, you're saying
there is a multiverse?

513
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,654
Cuz, I thought that was just theoretical.

514
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:45,493
I mean, that completely changes
how we understand the initial singularity.

515
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:47,954
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

516
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:49,948
And, how does that even work
with all the quantum?

517
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,950
It's insane.

518
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,246
Sorry.

519
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,276
It's really cool.

520
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:58,958
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

521
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:02,073
Anyway...

522
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:08,020
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

523
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,135
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

524
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,675
Air, water, fire, earth.

525
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:15,367
The Science Division had
a technical name.

526
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,699
We just called them Elementals.

527
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:19,974
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

528
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,850
Turns out, the myths are real.

529
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:22,941
Like Thor.

530
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:24,989
Thor was a myth and...

531
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:26,988
now I study him in my physics class.

532
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:29,530
These myths are threats.

533
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:32,249
They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.

534
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:33,752
We mobilized and fought them,

535
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:36,240
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

536
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,349
I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.

537
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,581
All we did was delay the inevitable.

538
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,475
The Elementals are here now,

539
00:32:43,477 --> 00:32:45,133
attacking the same coordinates.

540
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,296
Our satellites confirm it.

541
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,006
Thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

542
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,221
There's only one left.

543
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:51,197
Fire.

544
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:52,937
The strongest of them all.

545
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:55,098
The one that destroyed my Earth.

546
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,762
It's the one that took my family.

547
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,340
I'm sorry.

548
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,308
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

549
00:33:06,544 --> 00:33:07,670
We have one mission.

550
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:09,010
Kill it.

551
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:10,859
And you're coming with us.

552
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,054
I'm sorry, did you say Prague?

553
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:17,078
Mr. Fury, this all
seems like big-time,

554
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:19,624
you know, huge
superhero kind of stuff.

555
00:33:20,195 --> 00:33:23,729
And I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

556
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:25,623
Bitch, please.
You've been to space.

557
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,898
I know, but that was an accident.

558
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,531
Sir, come on.

559
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:29,198
There's got to be
someone else you can use.

560
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:32,132
What about Thor?
Off-world.

561
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:34,181
Ok, Doctor Strange.

562
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:35,676
Unavailable.
Captain Marvel.

563
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,922
Don't invoke her name.

564
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,906
Sir look I wanna help. I do.

565
00:33:39,294 --> 00:33:41,929
But if my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she's gonna kill me.

566
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,382
And if I'm seen like this in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

567
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,750
my class whole class
will figure out who I am, then...

568
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,610
Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, and then I'm done.

569
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:51,739
Ok.

570
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,278
I understand.

571
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,033
I'm sorry, what?

572
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,825
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

573
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,477
and become suspicious.

574
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:02,667
Dimitri.

575
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:05,098
Take him back to the hotel, please.

576
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,204
Yes.

577
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,610
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

578
00:34:08,473 --> 00:34:09,249
And...

579
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:10,663
good luck.

580
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:13,456
See you, kid.

581
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,966
Yeah, see you.

582
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,800
Bye, ma'am.
Yeah.

583
00:34:24,435 --> 00:34:27,474
Drink lots of water.
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

584
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,358
You cannot get sick, ok babe?
Ok. Thanks, baby.

585
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,037
Hey Ned, are you sure you're good?

586
00:34:32,357 --> 00:34:34,086
Dude, I'm fine.

587
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:35,293
Ok. Nice.
Don't worry.

588
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,282
Seriously, getting tranq'd
in the neck by Nick Fury,

589
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:40,221
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me anyway.

590
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,534
It is pretty awesome.
Yeah.

591
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,405
I'm just happy
I don't have to go to Prague.

592
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:44,527
Seriously.
Good news.

593
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:46,143
We're going to Prague.

594
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,868
What?
Prague?

595
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:49,533
Yeah.

596
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:51,770
Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

597
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,369
You should have heard
me on the phone with them.

598
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:55,008
I really gave them hell.

599
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,093
All I heard was crying.

600
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:59,225
Look at our upgraded ride.
Bro, you see that?

601
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,236
It's pretty sick.

602
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,126
I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.

603
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:03,385
Come on.

604
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,045
Peter, what?

605
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:06,605
What's going on?

606
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:10,648
I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.

607
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:14,139
I'm Mr. Harrington to the kids...

608
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:16,396
alright.
Ok.

609
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,607
Awesome.

610
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,445
Yeah. Awesome.

611
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,384
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

612
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:49,071
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

613
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,805
For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

614
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,920
Say EDITH.

615
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,386
<i>Stand by for retinal
and biometric scan.</i>

616
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,004
<i>Retinal and biometric scan accepted.</i>
Hello?

617
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:24,406
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

618
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,735
<i>I am EDITH,</i>

619
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,341
<i>Tony Stark's augmented-reality
security and defense system.</i>

620
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,520
So he made you for me?
<i>No.</i>

621
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:34,066
<i>But you have access
to all of Tony's protocols.</i>

622
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:34,941
Cool.

623
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:36,900
<i>Would you like to see what I can do?</i>

624
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:46,202
<i>EDITH stands for Even dead,
I'm the hero.</i>

625
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,244
<i>Tony loved his acronyms.</i>

626
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,447
Yeah, he did.

627
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,625
<i>I have access to the entire
Stark Global Security network,</i>

628
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,748
<i>including multiple defense satellites,</i>

629
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,206
<i>as well as back doors
to all major telecommunication networks.</i>

630
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,426
Is MJ texting?

631
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:11,980
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.
Hat's. That's wrong.

632
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,326
That's wrong.

633
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:32,857
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!

634
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,413
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

635
00:37:35,415 --> 00:37:37,299
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

636
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:38,884
Ten minutes, everyone.

637
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:42,438
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

638
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,803
Ok. I'll figure it out.
My gosh, it's so sick.

639
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,331
Yeah.
It's beautiful.

640
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,184
What?

641
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,304
Hello.

642
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:05,682
Close the door.

643
00:38:12,066 --> 00:38:13,073
I'm Peter Parker.

644
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,275
Take off your clothes.

645
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:17,664
Excuse me?

646
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,761
You told Fury Spider-Man
cannot be seen in Europe.

647
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:22,253
So I made you this, another suit.

648
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:25,510
Thank you.

649
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:29,495
I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try...
Take off your clothes.

650
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:30,691
Ok.

651
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,596
Sure.

652
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,771
It's a little embarrassing.
Now. Hurry up.

653
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,190
This is weird.

654
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:44,819
No, no, no! Don't go!

655
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:49,421
Sorry...

656
00:38:49,756 --> 00:38:51,828
I thought this was the bathroom.
This is not what it looks like.

657
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,605
Just...
Yeah.

658
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,997
What are you doing?
I'll leave you two alone.

659
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,774
Oh my God. Don't shoot anybody.

660
00:38:56,776 --> 00:38:58,789
Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.

661
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,563
Hey man, look.
Look.

662
00:39:00,565 --> 00:39:01,461
That's...
Peter,

663
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:03,499
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

664
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:06,898
If you want to hook up with some random
European chick on our school trip that's on you.

665
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,990
That's not what that was, honestly.

666
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:09,971
I can't pretend
I didn't see what I just saw.

667
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:12,139
I know you're trying to get with MJ.
It's obvious.

668
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,334
But I like her too.

669
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:14,442
Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

670
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:16,196
You cannot show her
that photo, dude, come on.

671
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:17,848
I'm sorry man. I have to.

672
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:19,539
She deserves the truth.

673
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:23,239
Ok, put your one foot
in front of the other,

674
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:25,153
and everybody back on the bus.

675
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,754
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!

676
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,593
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

677
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,076
EDITH?

678
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:37,078
<i>Hello, Peter. How can I help you?</i>

679
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:37,707
Hey...

680
00:39:38,468 --> 00:39:40,027
There's this guy in my class who's
kinda gonna ruin everything

681
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:40,655
with MJ...
<i>Peter,</i>

682
00:39:40,657 --> 00:39:41,754
<i>I'm having difficulty hearing you.</i>

683
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:43,365
<i>Can you please speak up?</i>

684
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,448
Brad Davis. He has a photo of me?

685
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:48,320
<i>Brad Davis. Is he a target?</i>

686
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,671
Is Brad a target?

687
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:57,513
Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.

688
00:39:57,515 --> 00:39:58,407
<i>Copy that.</i>

689
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,588
<i>Target is Brad Davis.
Initiating strike.</i>

690
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,049
Initiating what, now?

691
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:04,218
<i>Intercept point determined.</i>

692
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:05,636
<i>Releasing kill vehicle.</i>

693
00:40:05,638 --> 00:40:06,287
EDITH.

694
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,692
Oh my God.

695
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,886
Dope glasses, Parker.

696
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,614
How'd you pay for these?
Flash, give them back.

697
00:40:33,615 --> 00:40:34,308
No, no, no, no.
Flash!

698
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,679
I'm really paying you a compliment.
Please give me...

699
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,726
I'm so sorry.

700
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,201
EDITH, don't kill Brad.

701
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:44,713
<i>Peter, do you want me to cancel
the drone strike on Brad Davis?</i>

702
00:40:44,715 --> 00:40:45,841
Did you punch Flash?

703
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:47,061
No.
<i>Firing.</i>

704
00:40:50,475 --> 00:40:51,053
Look out!

705
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,427
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

706
00:40:57,713 --> 00:40:58,428
EDITH.

707
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,513
Is this the autobahn?
Appears to be.

708
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,451
<i>Commencing second strike.</i>
Peter.

709
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,749
Plant your fanny in that seat
and buckle up right now.

710
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:07,740
Look at the baby mountain goats!

711
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,004
Baby mountain goats?
I see them.

712
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,076
I don't see any mountain goats.

713
00:41:26,613 --> 00:41:27,791
You missed them.

714
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:30,357
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

715
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:31,446
What?

716
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,042
But your new look,

717
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:34,546
I love it.

718
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,359
Right, babe?
Thanks.

719
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:39,056
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy,
very European.

720
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,455
Man.

721
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,324
Let's try that again.

722
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,039
This is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

723
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,042
I... I...
Yeah.

724
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:49,844
Weird.

725
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,215
Freaking beautiful.
This is amazing.

726
00:42:23,005 --> 00:42:24,715
This place is so classy.

727
00:42:24,717 --> 00:42:26,098
Yeah, so why are we here?

728
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,537
Speak for yourself.

729
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:28,887
I'm home.

730
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,570
What can I say?

731
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:33,541
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

732
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:37,455
Everyone get settled in, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

733
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:40,930
is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.

734
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:42,258
Yeah!
Hello?

735
00:42:42,503 --> 00:42:44,764
<i>Parker, it's Hill.
There's an earpiece with your suit.</i>

736
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,106
<i>Put it on and await further instructions.
Understood?</i>

737
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:48,779
Yes, ma'am.
<i>Yeah.</i>

738
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:50,021
Hey, man.
Hey.

739
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:51,777
Look, I am so sorry,

740
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,757
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

741
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,193
You know I'm still your guy in the chair.

742
00:42:56,195 --> 00:42:57,948
No, no, no. It's all good.
Don't worry about it.

743
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,216
Ok. Great, great.
It's fine.

744
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,078
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

745
00:43:03,337 --> 00:43:04,729
Where's it gonna happen?

746
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:05,931
Here in the city.

747
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:08,120
Peter we're here.
I know. I know, it's not good.

748
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,418
I'm figuring it out.

749
00:43:10,094 --> 00:43:11,647
You have to do
something Peter, please.

750
00:43:11,649 --> 00:43:12,954
We're counting on you.

751
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:14,765
Ned.
Yeah. Yeah, babe.

752
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:16,983
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

753
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,257
It's about time.
Serious?

754
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,129
<i>Parker?</i>

755
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:21,968
Parker!
Yes, sir.

756
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,446
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

757
00:43:24,623 --> 00:43:25,801
Are we boring you?

758
00:43:26,094 --> 00:43:28,651
He's not bored. He's thinking
about how you kidnapped him.

759
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:29,679
He had obstacles.

760
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,974
I removed them.

761
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,900
They still won't evacuate the city.

762
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,113
Idiots.

763
00:43:37,054 --> 00:43:38,590
So, what's the plan, Parker?

764
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,013
I will be in the cathedral tower,

765
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:42,559
keeping watch for the fire monster.

766
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:44,915
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

767
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,074
and then Mr. Beck and I will...
My name is Mysterio.

768
00:43:51,926 --> 00:43:53,959
That's when Mysterio
and I will move in.

769
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,380
Peter, listen to me.

770
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:57,859
The best hope you have,
the only hope,

771
00:43:58,233 --> 00:43:59,640
is to stop it here now,

772
00:43:59,832 --> 00:44:01,083
no matter what the cost.

773
00:44:01,854 --> 00:44:03,714
Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,

774
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,676
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

775
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:08,154
If it gets too big,

776
00:44:08,156 --> 00:44:10,309
it'll be able to draw power
from the Earth's core.

777
00:44:10,546 --> 00:44:11,398
After that,

778
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,267
there is no way to stop it.

779
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:19,238
Hey, my friends are here.

780
00:44:19,687 --> 00:44:21,610
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

781
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,628
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

782
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:29,206
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

783
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:35,668
Stark gave you a multi-billion dollar
A.R. tactical intelligence system,

784
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:38,669
and the first thing you do with it is try
and blow up your friends.

785
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:43,528
It's clear to me
that you were not ready for this.

786
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:53,320
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

787
00:44:53,322 --> 00:44:55,406
He just...
He felt bad about snapping at you.

788
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:56,417
Really?

789
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:59,260
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

790
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:02,111
How you feeling?

791
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,568
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

792
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,641
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

793
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,915
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

794
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,132
and now it's all ruined.

795
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,971
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

796
00:45:32,244 --> 00:45:33,308
It's a hard path.

797
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,979
You see things. You do things.

798
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:37,368
You make choices.

799
00:45:38,704 --> 00:45:40,050
People look up to you...

800
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,047
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

801
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:47,530
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

802
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,902
There's a part of me
that wants me to tell you, just...

803
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:54,745
turn around, run away from all this.

804
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,244
Then there is another part of me that...

805
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,081
knows what we're about to fight,

806
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,957
what's at stake,

807
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:01,525
and I'm glad you're here.

808
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,427
Me too.

809
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:05,127
But...

810
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:06,555
you're worried about your friends.

811
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:07,666
Yeah.

812
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,155
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

813
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,660
Look just...

814
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:17,129
get them inside and keep them
in a safe place for just a few hours.

815
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:18,131
They'll be alright.

816
00:46:19,763 --> 00:46:20,794
It's really nice...

817
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,690
to have somebody to talk to about,

818
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:24,267
superhero stuff, you know?

819
00:46:26,062 --> 00:46:26,963
Anytime.

820
00:46:27,636 --> 00:46:28,467
And hey,

821
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:31,755
we survive this,
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

822
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,604
See you out there.

823
00:46:37,425 --> 00:46:38,137
Alright.

824
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,841
Mi scusi. Sorry, that's Italian.

825
00:46:48,303 --> 00:46:49,042
Ok.

826
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:51,424
EDITH?
Come on.

827
00:46:51,672 --> 00:46:52,970
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>
Hey.

828
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:56,183
I need to find a way to keep my friends
inside for the next few hours.

829
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:57,591
<i>Let's see what we can do.</i>

830
00:46:58,007 --> 00:46:59,068
Good news.

831
00:46:59,992 --> 00:47:01,135
We're going to the opera!

832
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:02,942
You're kidding me.
The opera?

833
00:47:03,463 --> 00:47:05,697
Don't look at me.
What happened to the carnival?

834
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,155
This is upgrade living, guys.

835
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:10,983
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

836
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:12,166
For free!

837
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:14,369
Do you have any idea how
much opera tickets cost?

838
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:17,847
No, because none of us have
ever wanted to go to the opera,

839
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:18,754
ever.

840
00:47:19,374 --> 00:47:21,711
Well, I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

841
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:22,847
Thank you, Ned.

842
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,273
Everyone,

843
00:47:24,874 --> 00:47:26,376
this is gonna be, maybe,

844
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:29,433
the best four hours of our whole trip.

845
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:30,758
Four hours?

846
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,340
Guys, I think this is gonna be
really fun. Seriously.

847
00:47:35,892 --> 00:47:39,012
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

848
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,646
Yeah, because we'd much rather go
to a four-hour opera

849
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:43,618
instead of the biggest party in the world.

850
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:45,446
Again, don't look at me.

851
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,825
<i>Parker, do you copy?</i>

852
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,481
<i>Comm check, one, two.</i>

853
00:47:51,973 --> 00:47:53,570
Ok, here we are.

854
00:47:54,615 --> 00:47:55,433
Beat the rush.

855
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:56,992
Yeah, the rush out.

856
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,440
Lucky for us,

857
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,369
we got the best seats in the house.

858
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:02,498
Let's go.

859
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,963
Hey. I'll save you a seat.

860
00:48:13,538 --> 00:48:15,060
You look really pretty.

861
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:16,510
And therefore, I have value?

862
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:19,709
No, that's not what I meant at all.
I was just...

863
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,746
I'm messing with you.

864
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,127
Thank you.

865
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:24,357
You're welcome.

866
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,690
You look pretty too.

867
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:27,202
Thank you.

868
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,696
Oh my gosh! Opera glasses!
So cute.

869
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,128
Can I?
Yeah.

870
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:33,334
Want to go in on a pair?

871
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,687
You mean us sit next to each other?

872
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:36,548
Yeah.

873
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,070
<i>Are you in position?</i>

874
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,317
No.

875
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:40,541
Ok. No...

876
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:43,126
<i>Why the hell not? Parker?</i>
You don't want to sit next to me,

877
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,060
or no you just don't want the glasses?

878
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:46,390
I didn't mean that.

879
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,485
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

880
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,677
I'll save you a seat next to me.

881
00:48:52,837 --> 00:48:55,096
A lot of seats, so I'll be up there.

882
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:56,820
Ok.

883
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:57,890
<i>Parker?</i>

884
00:48:58,188 --> 00:48:59,391
No, I'm coming. I'm...

885
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,422
Hey, I got to go.

886
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:04,200
Could you tell MJ that
I'm sick or something?

887
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:06,244
Ok. Be careful.

888
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:07,484
And whatever you do,

889
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:10,347
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

890
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,109
Yeah, Ned, I know.

891
00:49:12,346 --> 00:49:13,199
Ok.
Ok?

892
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,858
Yeah.
Gotta go.

893
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:30,947
<i>Parker!</i>

894
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:32,550
<i>You better be on your way.</i>

895
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,964
Coming.

896
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:42,795
Where do you think she's going?
Do you think she's going to the carnival?

897
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:44,987
I... I don't...
We should go. Yes, we should go.

898
00:49:45,044 --> 00:49:47,502
Come on, let's go. Come on.

899
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,204
Alright. I'm in position.

900
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:07,778
As soon as I see something, Beck, I'll...

901
00:50:08,229 --> 00:50:09,335
I'll let you know.

902
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,506
<i>Roger that.
How's the suit?</i>

903
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,662
The suit's great.

904
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:13,947
It's awesome.

905
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:16,263
It's a little tight around
the old web-shooter.

906
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:18,222
<i>Parker!</i>
Ok, I'll shut up.

907
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:20,739
My God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

908
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:23,074
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

909
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,138
What's wrong?

910
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,473
You know honestly, I just...

911
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,103
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should...

912
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,981
I have the perfect thing.
Come on.

913
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,120
Don't worry, babe.

914
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,539
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

915
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,665
You'll feel a thousand times better.

916
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,919
Energy spiking.
We have seismic activity.

917
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:07,800
Ok, he's here! Beck, you ready?

918
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,844
You know what to do.

919
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,220
On your lead, Spider-Man.

920
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,323
No, come back!

921
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,067
Come back and help us!

922
00:51:25,754 --> 00:51:26,995
You're up, kid.

923
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:40,891
Wait, wait, wait. Is that?

924
00:51:41,616 --> 00:51:42,887
Do you think that's Spider-Man?

925
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,333
No, no, no.
It's like a European rip-off version of him.

926
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,113
I was actually reading about him
the other day. It's not him.

927
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:03,593
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

928
00:52:03,774 --> 00:52:04,981
He's getting bigger!

929
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,155
What's his... What's his name?
What's his name?

930
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:09,078
Night... Night Monkey.

931
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,328
Night Monkey?
Yeah.

932
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:11,955
Yeah.
Night Monkey!

933
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,120
Yeah.
Night Monkey!

934
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:14,311
Help!
Night Monkey!

935
00:52:14,313 --> 00:52:15,047
Save us! What?

936
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,468
Night Monkey, we're stuck!

937
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:18,260
No, no.
Help us! Help!

938
00:52:33,408 --> 00:52:34,150
Are you ok?

939
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:39,404
On to Plan B?

940
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,254
Yeah!

941
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,929
We got to hit him
with something he can't absorb!

942
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:44,408
I go left, you go right! Now!

943
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:01,881
Ok, shoot him!

944
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,054
Yeah!

945
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,428
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

946
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,608
<i>Spider-Man, keep your distance.</i>

947
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,850
<i>I'm trying!</i>

948
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,525
<i>Can't let him get near
the Ferris wheel.</i>

949
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,151
<i>Ok. I'm on it!</i>

950
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,631
What is that?!

951
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,898
Betty! Betty!

952
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,505
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

953
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,399
No, no, no.

954
00:54:35,444 --> 00:54:36,425
It's too late.

955
00:54:37,987 --> 00:54:38,954
Whatever happens...

956
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,090
I'm glad we met.

957
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,319
Beck, what are you doing?

958
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,608
What I should have done last time.

959
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,946
Beck, don't do it!

960
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:58,702
Beck!

961
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,024
Mr. Beck?

962
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,394
Thank God.

963
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,798
I would totally kiss you, but I think
I just threw up in my mouth a little.

964
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,130
I might have a mint.

965
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,296
So it's over?

966
00:55:45,414 --> 00:55:46,747
That was the last of them.

967
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,355
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

968
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:53,439
We need to stay vigilant.

969
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:56,488
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

970
00:55:56,793 --> 00:55:59,952
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

971
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,640
You should join us.

972
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:04,568
Thank you.

973
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:06,541
I just might take you up on that.

974
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,667
You got gifts, Parker,

975
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:20,508
but you didn't wanna be here.

976
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,286
Mr. Fury, I...
I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

977
00:56:24,817 --> 00:56:28,129
But you got to decide whether
you're going to step up or not.

978
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,420
Stark chose you.

979
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:32,857
He made you an Avenger.

980
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:34,628
I need that.

981
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,971
The world needs that.

982
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:39,531
Maybe Stark was wrong.

983
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,755
Was he?

984
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,198
The choice is yours.

985
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,502
Let's get a drink.

986
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,157
I'm not 21.

987
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,475
Hey.

988
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,390
You got to celebrate.

989
00:57:21,478 --> 00:57:22,833
We did something good tonight.

990
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:23,781
Yeah.

991
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,367
Fury was right.

992
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,793
Tony did a lot for me so...

993
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,813
I owe it to him, to everybody.

994
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,576
Do you?

995
00:57:34,194 --> 00:57:35,708
Yeah. I mean...

996
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:38,690
Mr. Stark...

997
00:57:39,381 --> 00:57:40,499
gave me the chance to be more.

998
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,332
He wanted me to be better than him.

999
00:57:42,453 --> 00:57:45,327
And Fury just wants me to live up to that.
What do you want, Peter?

1000
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,693
What do you mean?
What do you want?

1001
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:51,160
I don't know.

1002
00:57:51,227 --> 00:57:52,808
What do you want, you?
Peter Parker. Now.

1003
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,811
I know you're thinking about it.
I wanna go on my trip.

1004
00:57:55,077 --> 00:57:55,744
Alright.

1005
00:57:55,746 --> 00:57:57,595
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

1006
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:00,709
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

1007
00:58:01,259 --> 00:58:04,312
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel and...

1008
00:58:06,388 --> 00:58:07,754
give her a kiss.

1009
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,705
Shut up, man.

1010
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,908
You're not gonna do that, are you?

1011
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:13,487
No, I can't.
Why not?

1012
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:15,778
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

1013
00:58:18,148 --> 00:58:20,053
Oh my God. Thank you so much.
What are those?

1014
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,149
Are those the?
EDITH glasses, yeah.

1015
00:58:22,204 --> 00:58:23,286
They were just on the floor?

1016
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,667
Try them on.
Let's see how they look on you.

1017
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:26,762
Yeah?
Yeah.

1018
00:58:30,626 --> 00:58:31,892
I actually really like them.

1019
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:33,978
Can I be completely honest with you?

1020
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:34,759
Please.

1021
00:58:35,324 --> 00:58:36,476
They look really stupid.

1022
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:40,558
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

1023
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,887
You try them on.

1024
00:58:42,203 --> 00:58:43,910
No, come on.
Try them on.

1025
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:46,074
I don't wanna try them on.
Just put them on.

1026
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,945
What do you think, kid?

1027
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,806
Next Tony Stark, I trust you.

1028
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,504
For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

1029
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,653
What?

1030
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,081
Mr. Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

1031
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,003
For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

1032
00:59:11,368 --> 00:59:13,672
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

1033
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,625
He knew every mistake I ever made.

1034
00:59:15,696 --> 00:59:18,256
Ok he must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

1035
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,721
Why give it to you?

1036
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:23,377
Because maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.

1037
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,256
It makes so much more sense.
He always knew I'd do what's right.

1038
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:28,014
And he's not gonna give them
to Fury because...

1039
00:59:28,016 --> 00:59:29,753
Fury would give himself EDITH.

1040
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:31,174
You're probably right about that.

1041
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,932
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

1042
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,593
And it's not gonna be me.
I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

1043
00:59:37,595 --> 00:59:40,312
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

1044
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,640
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

1045
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,932
No. Peter, come on.

1046
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:46,795
No.

1047
00:59:49,067 --> 00:59:50,308
EDITH?
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

1048
00:59:50,432 --> 00:59:51,525
Hi. Yeah...

1049
00:59:53,107 --> 00:59:56,020
I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.

1050
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:57,338
Peter, what are you doing?

1051
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,609
Doing the right thing.

1052
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:01,252
<i>Any transfer will require confirmation.</i>

1053
01:00:01,254 --> 01:00:03,127
Stark gave you the glasses.

1054
01:00:03,135 --> 01:00:05,650
Stark gave me a choice.
It's my choice to make, ok?

1055
01:00:05,652 --> 01:00:06,384
And I'm gonna make it.

1056
01:00:06,386 --> 01:00:08,882
Look you're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

1057
01:00:08,884 --> 01:00:10,913
You saved my life.
You saved the world.

1058
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:11,878
Ok?

1059
01:00:12,116 --> 01:00:13,516
He'd want you to have them.

1060
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:15,146
<i>Waiting for confirmation.</i>

1061
01:00:15,338 --> 01:00:16,206
Confirm.

1062
01:00:20,356 --> 01:00:21,767
Welcome to the Avengers.

1063
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,159
They look good on you.

1064
01:00:32,936 --> 01:00:33,936
Thank you.

1065
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:35,506
It's an honor.

1066
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36,966
Yeah.

1067
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:40,433
Mr. Stark would have really liked you.

1068
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,930
Where you headed?

1069
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,588
I'm gonna go find MJ.

1070
01:00:44,842 --> 01:00:45,723
Good luck, kid.

1071
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,367
I'll give you about a fifty-fifty chance.
You're pretty awkward, so...

1072
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,356
Yeah.

1073
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,120
See you later, man.

1074
01:00:52,364 --> 01:00:53,215
See you.

1075
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,055
See? That wasn't so hard.

1076
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,142
Yes!

1077
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:32,145
Somebody get this stupid
costume off me!

1078
01:01:39,668 --> 01:01:40,668
<i>Ok, we got EDITH.</i>

1079
01:01:40,889 --> 01:01:42,409
Get these connected to our system.

1080
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:44,951
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1081
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,701
No, this is a big win,
but we still got a lot of work to do.

1082
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,528
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1083
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,330
Yeah!

1084
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:53,154
Ok, toasts!

1085
01:01:54,048 --> 01:01:55,086
Give me that, Doug.

1086
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,073
To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.

1087
01:02:00,857 --> 01:02:02,083
The jester king.

1088
01:02:02,475 --> 01:02:06,545
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

1089
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:08,869
that he was unfit to wield.

1090
01:02:09,377 --> 01:02:11,133
Like the holographic system I designed.

1091
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,064
A revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications

1092
01:02:14,142 --> 01:02:16,425
that Tony turned
into a self-therapy machine

1093
01:02:16,545 --> 01:02:17,334
and renamed...

1094
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:20,938
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing,
or BARF.

1095
01:02:24,484 --> 01:02:28,085
$611 million
for my little therapeutic experiment.

1096
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,484
He renamed my life's work BARF.

1097
01:02:32,936 --> 01:02:34,143
I told him it was a mistake,

1098
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:36,261
that my technology could change
the world.

1099
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:38,921
And then...

1100
01:02:40,297 --> 01:02:41,292
he fired me.

1101
01:02:42,758 --> 01:02:43,993
Said I was...

1102
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:46,628
unstable.

1103
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,426
To Tony.

1104
01:02:49,576 --> 01:02:51,205
To Tony!

1105
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,723
Next, to William.
William!

1106
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:58,557
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

1107
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,685
With a box of scraps!

1108
01:03:01,553 --> 01:03:04,650
The integration of my illusion tech
with your weaponized drones,

1109
01:03:04,727 --> 01:03:05,614
was brilliant.

1110
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:08,326
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

1111
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:09,532
And it's just the beginning.

1112
01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:10,461
Thank you, brother.

1113
01:03:10,682 --> 01:03:11,629
To Guterman.

1114
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:12,934
Guterman!
To Guterman!

1115
01:03:12,981 --> 01:03:14,108
The story you created,

1116
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:16,012
of a soldier from another
Earth named Quentin,

1117
01:03:16,014 --> 01:03:19,081
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

1118
01:03:19,376 --> 01:03:22,023
and apparently exactly the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

1119
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:23,672
I mean, everybody bought it.

1120
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,414
Gutes!
Guterman!

1121
01:03:25,562 --> 01:03:27,506
To Victoria.
To Victoria!

1122
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,855
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

1123
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:32,195
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

1124
01:03:32,197 --> 01:03:33,567
Inspired idea.

1125
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:35,963
To Janice.
Janice!

1126
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:38,164
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered,

1127
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:40,195
that EDITH was being
handed over not to us,

1128
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:42,228
not to the Defense Department,

1129
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:43,444
but to a child.

1130
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,220
Thank you.
To Janice!

1131
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:47,534
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

1132
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:50,987
There is a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

1133
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,753
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

1134
01:03:53,755 --> 01:03:56,076
the most qualified and no one cares.

1135
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,705
Unless you're flying around with a cape
or shooting lasers from your hands,

1136
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,377
no one will even listen.

1137
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:05,246
Well,

1138
01:04:05,897 --> 01:04:07,956
I've got a cape and lasers.

1139
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,928
With our technology and with EDITH,

1140
01:04:11,118 --> 01:04:15,884
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

1141
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,058
Yeah!

1142
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,808
Then everyone will listen!

1143
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:24,618
Not to a boozy man-child.

1144
01:04:24,788 --> 01:04:26,145
No!

1145
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:28,958
Not to a hormonal teenager.

1146
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:30,407
No!

1147
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:31,960
To me...

1148
01:04:32,473 --> 01:04:35,411
and to my very wealthy crew.

1149
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,746
To us.
To us.

1150
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,309
To Mysterio!

1151
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,826
To Mysterio!

1152
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,316
To Peter Parker.

1153
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:44,140
To Peter Parker!

1154
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,167
Poor kid.

1155
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,133
Let's get to work.

1156
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,343
Peter, oh my God.
Hey. Hey.

1157
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:57,881
We almost died.
It's fine. It's fine.

1158
01:04:57,983 --> 01:04:59,510
Hey, I swear, I'm done with the mission.

1159
01:04:59,991 --> 01:05:01,846
Dude, the trip's over.
What?

1160
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:04,079
There's monsters coming out
of the ground everywhere we go.

1161
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,649
Of course our parents
would want us home.

1162
01:05:05,714 --> 01:05:08,833
Please don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

1163
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:10,780
Oh my God. Yes, good.

1164
01:05:10,872 --> 01:05:12,554
Stay here. Don't...
Put some clothes on.

1165
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,748
We're booking flights.

1166
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,194
We came for science,
we're leaving because of witches.

1167
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,846
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

1168
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,479
What is going on, dude?

1169
01:05:21,481 --> 01:05:22,676
We're going home in the morning.

1170
01:05:22,847 --> 01:05:24,629
No, no. All the Elementals are gone.

1171
01:05:24,811 --> 01:05:25,656
Ned.

1172
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:27,067
Coming, sweetie.

1173
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,979
Hey, can you guys keep it down?

1174
01:05:28,981 --> 01:05:29,991
I'm live-streaming.

1175
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:32,566
Yeah.

1176
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:33,710
Hey.

1177
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,408
Hey.

1178
01:05:35,792 --> 01:05:36,855
Where were you?

1179
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,895
I got lost.

1180
01:05:39,287 --> 01:05:40,650
We were worried about you.

1181
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,588
Good thing you're back.

1182
01:05:43,466 --> 01:05:44,250
Yeah.

1183
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,091
So much for Paris.

1184
01:05:46,669 --> 01:05:47,799
It would have been fun.

1185
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:48,307
Yeah.

1186
01:05:48,996 --> 01:05:50,257
Night.
Night.

1187
01:05:52,142 --> 01:05:53,009
You look ni...

1188
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:01,478
ok.

1189
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:04,704
Hey.
Hey.

1190
01:06:06,117 --> 01:06:06,857
Look...

1191
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,390
I'm not ready for this trip
to be over yet and...

1192
01:06:10,977 --> 01:06:12,756
I kind of want to do something fun

1193
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:16,893
that's not on the itinerary or planned
or with Mr. Harrington.

1194
01:06:16,895 --> 01:06:17,730
Yes.

1195
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,800
Yes, like you wanna go?

1196
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:21,965
Yes.

1197
01:06:23,578 --> 01:06:24,487
Ok, awesome.

1198
01:06:24,489 --> 01:06:25,935
I'll see you outside in ten minutes.

1199
01:06:26,258 --> 01:06:27,491
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1200
01:06:29,171 --> 01:06:30,225
Five is good.
Ok.

1201
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:31,868
Ok, bye.
Bye.

1202
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,902
<i>Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!</i>

1203
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,007
Hey.
Hey.

1204
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:50,288
So, where do you wanna go?

1205
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,326
Who cares?
Awesome.

1206
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:53,388
Ok.
Let's go.

1207
01:07:00,271 --> 01:07:02,550
I'm glad we're doing this.
Yeah, me too.

1208
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,276
To see the city a bit.

1209
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,742
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1210
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,599
They would put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.

1211
01:07:14,077 --> 01:07:16,034
Sorry.
It's ok.

1212
01:07:19,392 --> 01:07:22,844
There's this thing I've been wanting
to talk to you about

1213
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:24,955
for a while.

1214
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,548
Yeah?

1215
01:07:29,157 --> 01:07:30,773
It's our last night in Europe,

1216
01:07:30,783 --> 01:07:33,034
and I had this plan that I wanted to...

1217
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:34,390
tell you.

1218
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,337
I'm justl'm just gonna tell you.

1219
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,637
MJ, I...
I'm Spider-Man.

1220
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,203
What?

1221
01:07:43,296 --> 01:07:45,054
That's what you were gonna say.
That you're Spider-Man.

1222
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:47,478
No.

1223
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:49,746
I'm not Spider-Man.

1224
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:53,056
I mean, I've been watching you
for like a while now.

1225
01:07:53,722 --> 01:07:55,191
It's kind of obvious.

1226
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:57,417
I'm not Spider-Man.

1227
01:07:57,419 --> 01:07:59,832
I mean, what would make you think
that I was Spider-Man?

1228
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,904
Peter, Washington?
Yeah?

1229
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,875
The fact that you, like disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1230
01:08:06,031 --> 01:08:09,003
No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my... The tummy?

1231
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:10,712
You know Susan Yang
thinks you're a male escort.

1232
01:08:10,714 --> 01:08:12,920
What? No, of course
I'm not a male escort.

1233
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:13,912
Well, then you're Spider-Man.

1234
01:08:13,914 --> 01:08:15,916
No, I'm not Spider-Man at all.

1235
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:17,253
Then what about tonight?

1236
01:08:17,255 --> 01:08:18,889
You snuck off, and you fought that thing.

1237
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:19,513
I saw you.

1238
01:08:19,515 --> 01:08:21,928
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1239
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,473
And also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1240
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,087
The Night Monkey?
Yeah.

1241
01:08:26,089 --> 01:08:27,655
That's what it said on the news,

1242
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,690
and the news never lies.

1243
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,214
Night Monkey. Ok.

1244
01:08:33,872 --> 01:08:34,855
What are you doing?

1245
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:39,422
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man use the same webs?

1246
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,407
I mean, maybe.

1247
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:44,566
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1248
01:08:49,591 --> 01:08:52,208
Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1249
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:56,574
Yeah.

1250
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,328
Why else would I be watching you?

1251
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:02,970
Doesn't matter.

1252
01:09:03,947 --> 01:09:05,245
Just thought that maybe...

1253
01:09:10,907 --> 01:09:12,099
What the hell was that?

1254
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,981
I don't know.

1255
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,742
What is it, like some kind of projector
or something?

1256
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:30,375
Yeah, but it's...

1257
01:09:30,871 --> 01:09:32,304
really advanced.

1258
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:34,671
It... It looked so real.

1259
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:35,475
It...

1260
01:09:35,656 --> 01:09:37,024
Yeah, really real.

1261
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:39,546
Wait, does that mean that?

1262
01:09:39,674 --> 01:09:41,102
The Elementals are fake?

1263
01:09:41,913 --> 01:09:44,186
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1264
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,484
There was fire and destruction,

1265
01:09:46,876 --> 01:09:47,538
and...

1266
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:50,806
Who would do something like that?

1267
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,774
Mysterio.

1268
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,110
I am Spider-Man.

1269
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,638
And I've really messed up.

1270
01:10:10,724 --> 01:10:11,579
Wait.

1271
01:10:11,636 --> 01:10:13,075
You're being serious right now?

1272
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,457
You're not joking with me,
like you're 100 percent serious?

1273
01:10:15,459 --> 01:10:16,270
Because it's not funny.

1274
01:10:16,309 --> 01:10:17,086
No, I'm not joking.

1275
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,430
Because I was...
I was only like 67 percent sure.

1276
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,584
I... So why, why are you here?
MJ.

1277
01:10:21,586 --> 01:10:24,343
Why? Why are you on this school trip?
MJ, look..I know you have a lot of questions,

1278
01:10:24,476 --> 01:10:26,217
but look, but we have to get out of here, ok?

1279
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:29,577
Ok. Ok. I can't believe I figured it out!

1280
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:33,306
You took everything from me!

1281
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:36,058
This is for my family!

1282
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,900
Pause.

1283
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:46,867
Pause.

1284
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:48,925
Sorry.

1285
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:52,120
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1286
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,242
Yep. Stand by.

1287
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,450
Alright, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.

1288
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:01,743
Pause.

1289
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,376
I'm not in love with this choreography,
but it'll do.

1290
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:05,243
Kill image.

1291
01:11:06,214 --> 01:11:07,294
De-cloak drones.

1292
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,391
Alright, weapons.

1293
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,393
You want to weaponize?
Yep.

1294
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,384
Weapons only. Stand by.

1295
01:11:23,553 --> 01:11:24,378
<i>Nice.</i>

1296
01:11:25,178 --> 01:11:25,858
Stop.

1297
01:11:27,047 --> 01:11:29,324
Something. I don't know what it is.
It's something...

1298
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,733
Just dou... You know what?

1299
01:11:32,033 --> 01:11:33,872
Double the damage
and then run it again.

1300
01:11:34,349 --> 01:11:35,671
<i>You want me to double it up?</i>

1301
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:37,094
Yeah.
<i>Alright.</i>

1302
01:11:37,356 --> 01:11:38,293
Cover your ears.

1303
01:11:47,707 --> 01:11:49,573
That is good! That's good.

1304
01:11:50,563 --> 01:11:52,243
We on schedule?
<i>Yeah.</i>

1305
01:11:52,432 --> 01:11:54,717
<i>Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.</i>

1306
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:58,312
<i>With her drones, we'll create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.</i>

1307
01:11:58,402 --> 01:11:59,313
Alright, well done.

1308
01:11:59,377 --> 01:12:01,960
Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.
We need maximum damage.

1309
01:12:02,015 --> 01:12:04,109
That is gonna cause a lot of casualties.

1310
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:04,728
Yeah.

1311
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:07,376
More casualties, more coverage.
I got to cut through the static.

1312
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:10,319
London is a beautiful city,
and it will suffer but they can rebuild.

1313
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:12,132
I mean if I'm the next Iron Man,

1314
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:15,113
I need to save the world
from an Avengers level threat.

1315
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,014
But...

1316
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:19,750
when its new savior descends,

1317
01:12:19,924 --> 01:12:22,462
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1318
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,916
Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick-change armor for the victory lap?

1319
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,571
Of course. Do you wanna

1320
01:12:27,655 --> 01:12:28,794
try?
No, no, that's...

1321
01:12:28,948 --> 01:12:30,559
What's going on with my hand?
Why is that happening?

1322
01:12:32,174 --> 01:12:35,059
One of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector.

1323
01:12:35,061 --> 01:12:35,850
It's fine.

1324
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:37,047
Wait, and you're...

1325
01:12:37,511 --> 01:12:39,046
You're telling me this now?

1326
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,096
<i>It's... It's one drone.</i>

1327
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,000
<i>The image will be perfect, I promise.</i>

1328
01:12:43,002 --> 01:12:44,192
That projector is evidence.

1329
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:46,557
It's going to tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

1330
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:51,114
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,
including Nick Fury,

1331
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:54,631
who happens to be the most paranoid
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1332
01:12:54,868 --> 01:12:56,615
And if he catches on
before I've killed him,

1333
01:12:56,617 --> 01:12:57,914
he will put a bullet in my head.

1334
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,332
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1335
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,587
Right?

1336
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,956
William, can you look at me?

1337
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,252
Pull up EDITH.

1338
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,390
<i>Hello, Quentin.</i>

1339
01:13:14,392 --> 01:13:17,893
Yeah. Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,
full-resource protocol for this device.

1340
01:13:18,344 --> 01:13:19,380
<i>Magnifying.</i>

1341
01:13:20,748 --> 01:13:22,979
There. Search everything going in
and out of that building.

1342
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,108
<i>Located.</i>

1343
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,777
Shit.

1344
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,061
You know William,

1345
01:13:32,378 --> 01:13:33,028
one day,

1346
01:13:33,272 --> 01:13:35,688
after I've had to kill Peter Parker
because of this,

1347
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:37,127
I hope you remember,

1348
01:13:37,248 --> 01:13:38,329
that his blood,

1349
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,747
is on your hands!

1350
01:13:43,068 --> 01:13:45,365
I can't believe I gave Beck
those glasses.

1351
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:46,583
I mean, how could I be that stupid?

1352
01:13:46,585 --> 01:13:50,074
He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1353
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,918
You had access to killer drones?

1354
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:56,058
Yeah, I didn't really want them,
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1355
01:13:56,676 --> 01:13:58,010
You almost killed Brad?

1356
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:01,512
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury
and tell him that Beck's a fraud but...

1357
01:14:02,376 --> 01:14:04,507
I think he tapped my phone.
Ok, so what are you gonna do?

1358
01:14:05,443 --> 01:14:08,150
I need my suit and I have
to go to Berlin and...

1359
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:09,935
talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1360
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:15,864
Just...

1361
01:14:35,752 --> 01:14:36,664
Ned, perfect.

1362
01:14:37,301 --> 01:14:38,756
The costume looks great...

1363
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,627
for the costume party,

1364
01:14:41,629 --> 01:14:42,324
at the...

1365
01:14:42,874 --> 01:14:43,978
prince's castle.

1366
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,266
She knows. I told her.

1367
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,769
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1368
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:52,686
That's cool.
Like, a long time ago.

1369
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,907
Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1370
01:14:56,606 --> 01:14:58,360
But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1371
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,660
He's been faking the whole thing
with illusion tech.

1372
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,065
Yeah, he's using these, like,
hologram projectors.

1373
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:04,467
That's...

1374
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:05,867
crazy.

1375
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:06,744
Yeah.

1376
01:15:09,155 --> 01:15:12,289
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1377
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,383
It's been mostly me.

1378
01:15:14,265 --> 01:15:16,709
Look Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1379
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:19,382
say she wanted me to stay with family
in Berlin until all this blows over, ok?

1380
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,681
Got it. Easy.

1381
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:23,219
You guys lie with such ease.

1382
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:24,806
I got to go.

1383
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:27,057
Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1384
01:15:27,445 --> 01:15:28,637
You're gonna need this.

1385
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:31,406
Don't tell anyone about this, ok?

1386
01:15:31,408 --> 01:15:32,712
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1387
01:15:41,214 --> 01:15:42,370
So you know too.

1388
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:43,882
It's cool.

1389
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:47,167
I've known first, and I've known longer,
but it's not a competition.

1390
01:16:09,157 --> 01:16:10,518
Excuse me. Do you know where?

1391
01:16:10,892 --> 01:16:11,527
Nacht Monkey!

1392
01:16:11,529 --> 01:16:12,817
No, wait, I didn't...

1393
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:13,808
Oh man.

1394
01:16:16,889 --> 01:16:17,781
Get in.

1395
01:16:24,345 --> 01:16:25,093
Mr. Fury...

1396
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:27,525
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1397
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:29,788
No, no, no, listen.
Wait until we're secure.

1398
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,180
Ok.

1399
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:37,704
Right.

1400
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,325
So...

1401
01:17:05,105 --> 01:17:07,496
is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend?

1402
01:17:07,809 --> 01:17:08,989
He's talking about EDITH.

1403
01:17:09,274 --> 01:17:12,413
Look, I know I made a mistake and I'm sorry,
but he is not who you think he is.

1404
01:17:12,444 --> 01:17:15,059
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake.

1405
01:17:15,061 --> 01:17:16,552
He has some sort of illusion tech.

1406
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,504
That's how he tricked you guys
and tricked me into giving him EDITH.

1407
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,536
It's a projector.

1408
01:17:22,176 --> 01:17:23,661
I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.

1409
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:27,056
So all that death
and destruction we witnessed

1410
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,759
was created by this?

1411
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,970
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1412
01:17:31,756 --> 01:17:36,233
Well, if this is true, then Beck's
very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1413
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:37,975
Who else did you tell about this?

1414
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:39,879
Parker?

1415
01:17:40,398 --> 01:17:41,238
Parker!

1416
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,256
What's wrong?

1417
01:17:42,563 --> 01:17:43,819
It's Beck. He's here.

1418
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:45,268
What?

1419
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,499
Hill?

1420
01:17:51,978 --> 01:17:52,963
No, it's just an illu...

1421
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:55,414
Fury!

1422
01:18:01,294 --> 01:18:01,810
<i>Peter.</i>

1423
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,650
<i>I thought we were close.</i>

1424
01:18:05,433 --> 01:18:07,613
<i>Fury always had to die,</i>

1425
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,846
<i>but not you.</i>

1426
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,168
Stop hiding, Beck!

1427
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,805
<i>I tried to help you walk away.</i>

1428
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:16,850
<i>Now you're making me do this.</i>

1429
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,147
<i>You told me, you were just a kid.</i>

1430
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:26,938
<i>You told me,</i>

1431
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,956
<i>you wanted to run after that girl.</i>

1432
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,271
<i>Help me!</i>
MJ!

1433
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:32,913
God!

1434
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:36,741
Peter, what's going on?

1435
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:38,038
I know this isn't real.

1436
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,464
<i>Do you, though?</i>

1437
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:41,825
MJ!

1438
01:18:42,835 --> 01:18:43,489
MJ!

1439
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,339
<i>I don't think you know what's real, Peter.</i>

1440
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,899
<i>You need to wake up!</i>

1441
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:29,338
<i>I mean, look at yourself.</i>

1442
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,880
<i>You are just a scared little kid,</i>

1443
01:19:42,202 --> 01:19:43,770
<i>in a sweat suit.</i>

1444
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:49,654
<i>I created Mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in.</i>

1445
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,530
<i>I control the truth.</i>

1446
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,363
<i>Mysterio is the truth.</i>

1447
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,553
<i>If you were good enough,</i>

1448
01:20:20,084 --> 01:20:21,895
<i>maybe Tony would still be alive.</i>

1449
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,872
<i>Deep down, you know I'm right.</i>

1450
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,301
<i>You made your choice.</i>

1451
01:20:51,618 --> 01:20:53,427
<i>And all you had to do
was step aside.</i>

1452
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:57,303
<i>And now you have...</i>

1453
01:21:09,504 --> 01:21:10,141
Fury.

1454
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:12,249
Beck's people,

1455
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:13,525
are trying to find,

1456
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:15,637
everyone who could expose him.

1457
01:21:17,033 --> 01:21:18,033
Who'd you tell?

1458
01:21:18,513 --> 01:21:20,821
I know you told someone,
so just tell me.

1459
01:21:20,823 --> 01:21:22,458
Ok.
Who did you tell?

1460
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:25,684
Who else did you tell?
Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1461
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:28,034
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,
but that's it.

1462
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:30,560
What?

1463
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:33,175
You are so gullible.

1464
01:21:33,813 --> 01:21:34,502
What?

1465
01:21:34,699 --> 01:21:35,788
You're smart as a whip.

1466
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:36,974
Just a...

1467
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:38,930
sucker.

1468
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,265
And now all your friends have to die.
Oh my God.

1469
01:21:47,239 --> 01:21:50,020
It's easy to fool people when
they're already fooling themselves.

1470
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:56,893
But for what it's worth, Peter,

1471
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,072
I really am sorry.

1472
01:22:09,846 --> 01:22:11,114
EDITH.
<i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1473
01:22:11,155 --> 01:22:13,430
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1474
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,588
I need them to fly home from London.

1475
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,305
Hi.

1476
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,510
Where am I?

1477
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,672
Municipal holding facility.

1478
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,518
They said they found you
unconscious at the train yard.

1479
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:05,771
Very dangerous.

1480
01:23:06,099 --> 01:23:08,914
And we gave you the shirt
because you seemed a bit cold.

1481
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:10,418
Thanks.

1482
01:23:12,977 --> 01:23:14,058
You guys are nice.

1483
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,072
You speak really good English.

1484
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:18,942
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1485
01:23:20,103 --> 01:23:21,517
I'm in the Netherlands right now?

1486
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:22,329
Yep.

1487
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:25,023
Bye.

1488
01:23:26,028 --> 01:23:26,918
Guard!

1489
01:23:27,508 --> 01:23:29,734
The guard is on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.

1490
01:23:29,736 --> 01:23:31,648
Yeah, she's pregnant.
Yeah?

1491
01:23:31,687 --> 01:23:32,538
Yeah.

1492
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:41,638
Yeah.

1493
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,152
Yeah.

1494
01:23:44,183 --> 01:23:45,072
Night Monkey.

1495
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:46,036
Yeah.

1496
01:23:50,877 --> 01:23:52,038
You guys ok?

1497
01:24:04,563 --> 01:24:06,018
Excuse me, sir?
Yeah?

1498
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:08,228
Could I borrow your phone?
Yeah.

1499
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,928
Take care.

1500
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:11,077
Everyone is so nice here.

1501
01:24:12,675 --> 01:24:13,457
Ok.

1502
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,720
Ok.

1503
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,806
Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey...

1504
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:28,027
I messed up. I need a...
I need a ride.

1505
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:30,387
Where am I?

1506
01:24:30,753 --> 01:24:31,686
Where am I, sir?

1507
01:24:31,907 --> 01:24:33,230
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1508
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,899
Hang on.
Could you say that into there?

1509
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,037
Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1510
01:24:42,012 --> 01:24:42,950
Yeah, no problem.

1511
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:44,618
Thanks.

1512
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:46,622
Did you get that?

1513
01:25:08,259 --> 01:25:08,940
Peter?

1514
01:25:09,498 --> 01:25:10,554
Are you ok?

1515
01:25:10,826 --> 01:25:12,040
Happy, is that you?

1516
01:25:12,209 --> 01:25:13,646
Is it me... yeah, of course it's me.

1517
01:25:13,787 --> 01:25:14,567
Stop!

1518
01:25:15,492 --> 01:25:17,153
Tell me something only you would know.

1519
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,515
Only I would know...

1520
01:25:20,062 --> 01:25:21,854
Remember when we went to Germany?

1521
01:25:22,081 --> 01:25:23,849
You pay-per-viewed a video
in your room?

1522
01:25:24,098 --> 01:25:26,051
They didn't list the titles,
but I could tell by the price,

1523
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:27,627
it was an adult film at the front desk.

1524
01:25:27,683 --> 01:25:28,957
And you didn't know how I knew...
Ok, ok.

1525
01:25:28,994 --> 01:25:30,559
Fine! It's you. It's you. Stop.

1526
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,127
It's so good to see you.

1527
01:25:36,685 --> 01:25:38,666
Peter, you're going to have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1528
01:25:40,173 --> 01:25:41,382
Ok, hold still.

1529
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:42,885
There we go.

1530
01:25:50,696 --> 01:25:51,994
I thought you had super strength.

1531
01:25:52,222 --> 01:25:53,204
It still hurts.

1532
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,059
Happy, come on.
Alright, relax.

1533
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,113
Just a few more. There we go.
Oh my God, Happy.

1534
01:26:02,255 --> 01:26:03,042
Relax.

1535
01:26:03,044 --> 01:26:04,255
Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1536
01:26:04,257 --> 01:26:06,553
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1537
01:26:07,415 --> 01:26:08,566
I trusted Beck.

1538
01:26:09,013 --> 01:26:09,761
Right?

1539
01:26:10,094 --> 01:26:13,633
I thought he was my friend. So I gave him
the only thing Mr. Stark left behind for me,

1540
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:15,863
and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe,

1541
01:26:15,865 --> 01:26:18,280
so please do not tell me to relax.

1542
01:26:20,646 --> 01:26:22,709
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I should not shout.

1543
01:26:26,584 --> 01:26:27,772
I just really miss him.

1544
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,175
Yeah, I miss him too.

1545
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,650
Everywhere I go...

1546
01:26:36,067 --> 01:26:37,293
I see his face.

1547
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:38,287
And...

1548
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:41,884
the whole world is asking who's
gonna be the next Iron Man and...

1549
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:47,451
I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.

1550
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,329
You're not Iron Man.

1551
01:26:52,527 --> 01:26:54,248
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1552
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,923
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1553
01:26:58,830 --> 01:26:59,972
Not even Tony.

1554
01:27:01,696 --> 01:27:02,898
Tony was my best friend.

1555
01:27:03,757 --> 01:27:04,873
And he was a mess.

1556
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:08,300
He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.

1557
01:27:09,388 --> 01:27:12,301
The one thing that he did that he didn't
second-guess was picking you.

1558
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,186
I don't think Tony
would have done what he did,

1559
01:27:18,102 --> 01:27:20,942
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1560
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,388
Now, your friends are in trouble,

1561
01:27:24,738 --> 01:27:25,879
you're all alone,

1562
01:27:26,068 --> 01:27:27,362
your tech is missing.

1563
01:27:29,356 --> 01:27:30,621
What are you gonna do about it?

1564
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,675
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1565
01:27:38,139 --> 01:27:39,538
But I mean, I mean, I mean right now.

1566
01:27:39,683 --> 01:27:41,142
Like specifically
what are we gonna do?

1567
01:27:41,144 --> 01:27:43,881
Because we've been hovering over
a tulip field for the last 15 minutes.

1568
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,880
Right. I can't call my friends
because he's tracking their phones.

1569
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:48,406
Give me your phone.

1570
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:49,879
My cell phone?
Yeah.

1571
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,464
Ok. Here.

1572
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:53,945
What's your password?
Password.

1573
01:27:54,366 --> 01:27:55,759
No, what is your password?

1574
01:27:55,761 --> 01:27:57,550
Password, the word spelled out,
password.

1575
01:27:57,552 --> 01:27:59,655
Head of security,
and your password is password?

1576
01:27:59,657 --> 01:28:00,884
I don't feel good about it either.

1577
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,275
<i>Hello, governor.
Cup of tea for you?</i>

1578
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:04,154
<i>I'm gonna be in London soon.</i>

1579
01:28:04,163 --> 01:28:05,894
They're in London.
London, ok.

1580
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,148
Yeah, I need a suit.
Suit?

1581
01:28:29,987 --> 01:28:30,753
Ok...

1582
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,382
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1583
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:42,530
Yeah, open that.

1584
01:28:42,774 --> 01:28:44,431
Ok, no, no, no.

1585
01:28:51,752 --> 01:28:52,752
What?

1586
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:53,622
Nothing.

1587
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,904
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1588
01:29:01,353 --> 01:29:02,911
I love Led Zeppelin.

1589
01:29:08,914 --> 01:29:10,528
Ok, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1590
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,584
Isolate the Taser webs,

1591
01:29:13,586 --> 01:29:15,264
and reconfigure and boost,

1592
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:17,746
the voltage to a factor of...

1593
01:29:17,873 --> 01:29:22,013
25 percent and give me complete
manual control over detonation.

1594
01:29:25,294 --> 01:29:28,443
I thought Kree having sleeper cells
was top secret information.

1595
01:29:28,445 --> 01:29:29,098
Nick,

1596
01:29:29,476 --> 01:29:31,227
satellites are picking up an EM pulse.

1597
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:32,685
I thought that was over.

1598
01:29:32,832 --> 01:29:34,451
It's the biggest one yet.
Where?

1599
01:29:35,072 --> 01:29:35,864
London.

1600
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:38,347
Ok guys, the company set up a city tour,

1601
01:29:38,349 --> 01:29:40,744
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1602
01:29:43,894 --> 01:29:46,003
Is no one else going
to acknowledge how crazy this is?

1603
01:29:46,021 --> 01:29:47,307
Yeah, I get it.

1604
01:29:47,545 --> 01:29:50,162
There's been nothing scientific
about this science tour at all.

1605
01:29:50,346 --> 01:29:51,899
No, no, no..
I'm talking about Peter.

1606
01:29:52,001 --> 01:29:53,928
Has no one else here noticed
how shady he is?

1607
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,403
Because I saw him in the back
room of a rest stop with some...

1608
01:29:56,436 --> 01:29:57,814
woman in his underwear,

1609
01:29:57,816 --> 01:30:00,443
and he's always sneaking away,
like back at the opera?

1610
01:30:01,423 --> 01:30:03,022
And now he's suddenly off the trip,

1611
01:30:03,045 --> 01:30:04,731
with his family in Berlin?

1612
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,191
Is no one else interested in the truth?

1613
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:12,161
The very concept of objective truth
is fading out of the world.

1614
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:13,485
George Orwell.

1615
01:30:13,799 --> 01:30:14,885
Thank you, MJ.
Yeah.

1616
01:30:14,964 --> 01:30:17,617
Well, I mean since Peter's
not really here to tell his truth,

1617
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:19,747
what about you, Brad?

1618
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:22,094
Why do you think it's cool to take
pictures of people in the bathroom?

1619
01:30:22,096 --> 01:30:23,760
Yeah dude, what's that about?

1620
01:30:23,895 --> 01:30:25,684
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was...

1621
01:30:26,604 --> 01:30:29,483
I was trying to take a...
Let's just put all this craziness behind us

1622
01:30:29,905 --> 01:30:32,767
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1623
01:30:32,963 --> 01:30:35,128
Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,
said the class.

1624
01:30:35,483 --> 01:30:36,225
Ok.

1625
01:30:37,325 --> 01:30:39,068
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1626
01:30:39,838 --> 01:30:42,260
You got to stop doing that, ok?
It is weird.

1627
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:46,018
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1628
01:30:46,395 --> 01:30:46,906
Ok?

1629
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:48,093
Look at this, guys.
Mr. Harrington.

1630
01:30:48,787 --> 01:30:49,360
Come along.

1631
01:30:49,565 --> 01:30:50,879
We got a bus all to ourselves.

1632
01:30:50,881 --> 01:30:52,774
Nice to see you all. Come along.

1633
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,943
I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
Thank you.

1634
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:56,610
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1635
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,233
Alright.

1636
01:30:59,096 --> 01:31:00,276
I have the kids.

1637
01:31:04,836 --> 01:31:06,075
<i>I got here as fast as I could.</i>

1638
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,464
<i>I did a full perimeter sweep.</i>

1639
01:31:08,123 --> 01:31:08,819
<i>Nothing.</i>

1640
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:10,673
Damn it.

1641
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:14,167
Pulse is spiking.

1642
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,399
<i>I'll take another look.</i>

1643
01:31:15,487 --> 01:31:17,148
Soon as you see something, report.

1644
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,563
<i>You're all we've got, Beck.</i>

1645
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:22,740
If this is what I fear,
then God help us, Fury.

1646
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:25,060
God help us all.

1647
01:31:26,675 --> 01:31:28,632
Ok, people, no Avengers coming.
We're good to go.

1648
01:31:28,779 --> 01:31:30,436
<i>William, launch the drones.</i>

1649
01:31:30,438 --> 01:31:31,508
Copy that, brother.

1650
01:31:31,769 --> 01:31:34,965
<i>Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.</i>

1651
01:31:40,856 --> 01:31:43,141
Excellent. Janice?
Still working on the cape.

1652
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:46,036
I got to get those wrinkles out in a few hours.
I could literally be shaking hands with the queen.

1653
01:31:46,266 --> 01:31:47,679
<i>Guterman?</i>
Almost in position.

1654
01:31:47,804 --> 01:31:48,782
Ok. Hit it, Victoria.

1655
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:50,193
Increasing pulse.

1656
01:31:52,539 --> 01:31:55,375
Whatever this thing is, it's 100 times
bigger than the previous ones.

1657
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:56,325
EDITH?

1658
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:57,739
<i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1659
01:31:58,739 --> 01:32:00,137
Show me my loose ends.

1660
01:32:01,053 --> 01:32:03,758
Once the show's going,
execute the kill order on my command.

1661
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:05,078
<i>Copy.</i>
Alright.

1662
01:32:05,205 --> 01:32:06,286
Start the show.

1663
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:10,231
Let's save the world, people.

1664
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,356
I don't like this. Something's definitely up.

1665
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:16,846
You're an FOS now.

1666
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:18,490
Friend of Spider-Man.

1667
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:21,033
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1668
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,656
That doesn't look good.

1669
01:32:26,997 --> 01:32:29,032
But it's fake, so there is
nothing to worry about.

1670
01:32:29,654 --> 01:32:32,288
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1671
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,372
<i>Great work, Guterman.</i>

1672
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,319
What?
<i>Happy here. Happy Hogan here.</i>

1673
01:32:39,507 --> 01:32:40,644
I know. What do you want?

1674
01:32:40,646 --> 01:32:42,618
<i>Over at Mr. Stark's,
going through his belongings.</i>

1675
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,746
<i>Apparently, there was a
surfboard that you left behind.</i>

1676
01:32:44,748 --> 01:32:45,273
What?

1677
01:32:45,275 --> 01:32:46,061
<i>People there said,</i>

1678
01:32:46,063 --> 01:32:48,027
<i>they didn't think Nick Fury
was a surfer, but I said.</i>

1679
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:49,088
<i>Appearances can be deceiving.</i>

1680
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:52,025
It's not mine. And don't ever
call this number again.

1681
01:33:00,436 --> 01:33:02,527
Ok, Fury's got the coded message.

1682
01:33:03,384 --> 01:33:04,532
Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.

1683
01:33:04,533 --> 01:33:05,033
Ok.

1684
01:33:05,034 --> 01:33:06,667
Your boy called it London Bridge,
but I figured it out.

1685
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:09,115
I'm going to go scoop them up, ok?
Yeah.

1686
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,455
We're close.
We're close.

1687
01:33:10,457 --> 01:33:11,784
How's the suit coming?
Almost done.

1688
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:13,961
Good.
Wait, wait. Before you go...

1689
01:33:15,074 --> 01:33:17,502
if something happens to me,
could you please give this to MJ?

1690
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:18,756
You're gonna make it back.

1691
01:33:18,758 --> 01:33:19,755
You'll give it to her yourself.

1692
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,299
Ok? You got this.
I got this.

1693
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:22,531
Now, walk me through it.

1694
01:33:22,961 --> 01:33:24,292
I know it's illusion tech, right?

1695
01:33:24,294 --> 01:33:27,466
All I have to do is get inside the illusion,
then I can take it down,

1696
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:30,339
find him, and he's just a guy,
so I can take EDITH right back.

1697
01:33:30,362 --> 01:33:32,684
Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.

1698
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,363
True, but this time...

1699
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:37,176
How do I explain this?

1700
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:39,057
I have like a sixth sense.

1701
01:33:39,201 --> 01:33:40,107
The Peter-tingle.

1702
01:33:41,229 --> 01:33:42,477
That's what you're talking about, right?

1703
01:33:42,718 --> 01:33:43,925
It's not working, though.

1704
01:33:43,964 --> 01:33:45,554
I heard it wasn't working right now.

1705
01:33:45,556 --> 01:33:46,567
Is it?
It is working.

1706
01:33:46,723 --> 01:33:48,212
Well, I don't know if it's working.
Good.

1707
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:49,247
Ok, so you got the Peter-tingle.

1708
01:33:49,348 --> 01:33:51,206
That's the plan.
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1709
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:53,313
You get that Peter-tingle back online.

1710
01:33:54,134 --> 01:33:55,473
I got this. I got this.

1711
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:10,755
Cue the lightning.

1712
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:11,993
Cuing lightning.

1713
01:34:17,771 --> 01:34:20,102
Sir, is it still safe on the top,
or should we all...

1714
01:34:20,663 --> 01:34:21,688
come down?

1715
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:22,781
Oh my...

1716
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:27,399
What did the bus driver say?
Bus driver's gone.

1717
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:29,036
What?
Where?

1718
01:34:29,264 --> 01:34:32,130
It's ok. Mr. Dell and I have it
under control!

1719
01:34:32,132 --> 01:34:33,976
No. No. Don't drag me into this, Roger.

1720
01:34:33,978 --> 01:34:35,732
I'm doing my best, Julius!

1721
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,030
Look...

1722
01:34:37,475 --> 01:34:38,671
the witches are back.

1723
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:40,588
Oh my God, get off the bus!

1724
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,014
Ok. Ok, follow me, kids.

1725
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:52,388
Come on, let's go!

1726
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:08,273
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1727
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,472
This way. This way!

1728
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,345
Ok. Ok.
My God!

1729
01:35:28,744 --> 01:35:30,138
Flash!
Follow that cursed hand.

1730
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:31,841
This way, kids. Follow me.

1731
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:35,053
It's not real, it's not real!
Well, it looks pretty real to me!

1732
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,432
Follow me, kids!

1733
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:38,689
Earth, wind, fire, water.

1734
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:39,608
Oh no.

1735
01:35:39,932 --> 01:35:41,689
They joined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1736
01:35:42,104 --> 01:35:43,817
You're thinking of Voltron.
Who?

1737
01:35:43,856 --> 01:35:45,437
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1738
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:47,318
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1739
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,615
He's gonna save us!

1740
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:53,701
Wait, if Mysterio knows we know...

1741
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,081
Then we're in danger.
Yeah, and so are they.

1742
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:56,874
We should go.

1743
01:35:58,836 --> 01:35:59,836
Kill that witch!

1744
01:36:01,974 --> 01:36:04,336
This is for my family!

1745
01:36:06,216 --> 01:36:07,550
You should get somewhere safe, Fury.

1746
01:36:07,949 --> 01:36:09,531
<i>I don't see this ending well.</i>

1747
01:36:09,862 --> 01:36:11,473
I appreciate your concern,

1748
01:36:11,674 --> 01:36:13,596
but I never leave my men behind.

1749
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,393
Alright, comms check.
Can you hear me, kid?

1750
01:36:17,395 --> 01:36:20,106
I can. It's a little loud out here.
I like the new suit.

1751
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:20,988
Thanks.

1752
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:23,317
Peter, you sure that's not real?

1753
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:26,083
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1754
01:36:26,085 --> 01:36:26,983
Still the play?

1755
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,815
We need to get high enough
so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1756
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:30,657
Copy.

1757
01:36:30,932 --> 01:36:31,964
<i>Stay sticky.</i>

1758
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,997
<i>Hey, Happy.
Yeah, kid. What is it?</i>

1759
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,362
We need to have a serious conversation
about you and my aunt!

1760
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:56,397
Beck, report!

1761
01:36:56,686 --> 01:36:57,762
Hey Guterman, I need..

1762
01:36:57,764 --> 01:36:59,195
I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1763
01:36:59,312 --> 01:37:02,600
It's all the Elementals.
They're somehow merged into something...

1764
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,642
into something else.
Something more powerful.

1765
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:06,728
It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.

1766
01:37:11,773 --> 01:37:13,367
See, now, that's some bullshit.

1767
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:18,210
Is that?

1768
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,001
Be ready for anything.

1769
01:37:24,499 --> 01:37:25,253
Yeah.

1770
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:33,591
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!

1771
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:41,474
That's awesome.

1772
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:09,332
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1773
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,240
Well, maybe they hit a
flock of birds or something.

1774
01:38:11,242 --> 01:38:11,938
You're fine.

1775
01:38:12,047 --> 01:38:14,117
Well, I wanna see what's happening there.
I'm taking manual control.

1776
01:38:20,783 --> 01:38:22,170
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

1777
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:23,609
Yeah.

1778
01:38:24,935 --> 01:38:25,853
And I'm gonna kill him.

1779
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,354
I hope this works.

1780
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:49,548
You got me?

1781
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:55,637
I got you.

1782
01:38:56,291 --> 01:38:58,032
<i>Boss, the illusion is coming apart.</i>

1783
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:02,768
I see you.

1784
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,850
EDITH, give me some protection.
<i>Copy.</i>

1785
01:39:23,644 --> 01:39:24,984
Hey kill it. Just kill the illusion.
Kill it.

1786
01:39:24,986 --> 01:39:26,503
No, I'm not gonna kill it.
They'll see you.

1787
01:39:26,505 --> 01:39:29,220
They'll see what I want them,
to see!

1788
01:39:29,222 --> 01:39:31,026
Do you still need the cape?
Yes, Janice.

1789
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:33,222
I still need the cape.

1790
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:34,419
Done.

1791
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:37,779
Now William,

1792
01:39:37,781 --> 01:39:39,462
<i>render my illusion suit.</i>
Alright, hang on.

1793
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,671
<i>The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!</i>

1794
01:39:41,796 --> 01:39:43,037
There you are.

1795
01:39:46,696 --> 01:39:47,777
Easy.

1796
01:39:52,197 --> 01:39:53,392
Who the hell is that?

1797
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,105
Ned!
Happy!

1798
01:39:56,963 --> 01:39:58,956
I got to get you guys out of here!
Get on the jet!

1799
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:00,924
Who are you?
I work with Spider-Man, ok?

1800
01:40:00,926 --> 01:40:02,740
You got to get on that jet.
You work for Spider-Man?

1801
01:40:03,045 --> 01:40:04,922
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1802
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,328
New plan. Into the Tower.
What?

1803
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:13,380
Happy, are you ok?
<i>Yeah, we're ok. Just get Beck.</i>

1804
01:40:13,598 --> 01:40:15,833
EDITH, target Spider-Man.
<i>Copy.</i>

1805
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,275
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1806
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:38,522
There you are.

1807
01:40:41,203 --> 01:40:42,681
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1808
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,842
Yeah, go, go, go!
Come on.

1809
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:51,135
Go! Into the vault!
The walls are 8 feet thick.

1810
01:40:51,137 --> 01:40:52,253
Go into the vault!

1811
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,986
What?
Into the vault. Go!

1812
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,592
Take cover!

1813
01:41:16,696 --> 01:41:17,696
Ok.

1814
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,410
Yeah?

1815
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,194
No. No.

1816
01:41:29,559 --> 01:41:30,845
I see you.

1817
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:33,962
Get that thing out...

1818
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:40,671
Go!

1819
01:41:47,681 --> 01:41:49,138
How does Cap do that?

1820
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:02,155
Happy, say something, please,
to let me know you're alive!

1821
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:03,450
<i>I'm here. I'm here.</i>

1822
01:42:03,529 --> 01:42:04,606
Happy, thank God.

1823
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,211
I bought us some time.

1824
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:09,534
But not much.
<i>I'm trying to get to Beck,</i>

1825
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,286
but I can't shake these drones!

1826
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:27,182
Gotcha.

1827
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:50,574
Going up!

1828
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,992
Finally.

1829
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:32,517
Hey, William, how we doing?
Illusion almost back up.

1830
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:34,872
<i>I don't know
how you're gonna spin this.</i>

1831
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,343
Great. No webs.

1832
01:44:05,069 --> 01:44:07,311
Are we gonna die?
Nobody dies on my watch.

1833
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:12,880
I wasted my life playing video games,
and we're gonna die.

1834
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:16,784
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1835
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:20,234
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1836
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:20,890
Hey,

1837
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:22,872
if it wasn't for
those stupid videos,

1838
01:44:23,273 --> 01:44:24,631
Spider-Man would have
never found you.

1839
01:44:25,754 --> 01:44:27,203
Spider-Man?
Spider-Man follows me?

1840
01:44:28,003 --> 01:44:28,916
I saved us, guys.

1841
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,636
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1842
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:32,134
MJ!
Stop it!

1843
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:33,590
I'm sorry, ok?

1844
01:44:33,762 --> 01:44:36,831
I'm just. I'm obsessed with telling the truth
even if it hurts other people's feelings.

1845
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:39,888
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1846
01:44:44,354 --> 01:44:45,370
We're sharing, right?

1847
01:45:24,896 --> 01:45:26,263
Your lies are over, Beck.

1848
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:29,591
This certainly isn't ideal but...

1849
01:45:29,593 --> 01:45:30,940
I have contingencies.

1850
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:31,863
EDITH?

1851
01:45:40,349 --> 01:45:42,000
Just give me the glasses.

1852
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:43,911
You want these?

1853
01:45:46,168 --> 01:45:47,168
Come and get them.

1854
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:58,720
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1855
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,962
Why aren't these drones firing?

1856
01:46:24,964 --> 01:46:26,078
<i>You're in the strike zone.</i>

1857
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:30,962
<i>The chance of getting hit is...</i>
No, fire all the drones now!

1858
01:46:49,463 --> 01:46:50,197
Beck!

1859
01:46:54,699 --> 01:46:55,411
Beck.

1860
01:46:56,368 --> 01:46:57,652
You lied to me.

1861
01:46:58,623 --> 01:46:59,767
I trusted you.

1862
01:47:00,153 --> 01:47:01,082
I know.

1863
01:47:01,358 --> 01:47:02,615
That's the most...

1864
01:47:03,351 --> 01:47:05,092
disappointing part.

1865
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:08,421
You're a good person, Peter.

1866
01:47:10,887 --> 01:47:12,418
Such a weakness.

1867
01:47:14,732 --> 01:47:16,130
Stark was right.

1868
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,342
You do deserve them.

1869
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:31,731
You can't trick me anymore.

1870
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:37,257
EDITH, turn off the drones.

1871
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:40,373
<i>Biometric scan complete.</i>

1872
01:47:40,663 --> 01:47:41,829
<i>Welcome back, Peter.</i>

1873
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:44,748
<i>Shall I execute all cancellation protocols?</i>
Just do it.

1874
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:46,786
Execute them all.
<i>Confirmed.</i>

1875
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:56,967
Give me the spear.

1876
01:47:58,263 --> 01:47:59,325
That's a halberd.

1877
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:05,478
Thank you.

1878
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:11,260
How could you do all of this?

1879
01:48:12,082 --> 01:48:13,327
You'll see, Peter.

1880
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:15,662
People,

1881
01:48:16,398 --> 01:48:17,880
they need to believe.

1882
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:20,734
And nowadays...

1883
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:24,909
they'll believe anything.

1884
01:48:35,926 --> 01:48:36,770
Is he?

1885
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:39,545
Is this real?

1886
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,052
<i>All illusions are down, Peter.</i>

1887
01:48:58,781 --> 01:48:59,414
Yeah!

1888
01:49:00,007 --> 01:49:01,023
Hey, where you going?

1889
01:49:09,227 --> 01:49:10,329
MJ.
Hey.

1890
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:12,372
Hey.
Hey.

1891
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:14,079
Are you ok?
I'm ok. Are you ok?

1892
01:49:14,173 --> 01:49:15,488
Yeah. Yeah.

1893
01:49:15,742 --> 01:49:16,759
Is everybody else ok?

1894
01:49:16,761 --> 01:49:17,990
Yeah, everyone's ok.

1895
01:49:19,832 --> 01:49:22,198
What happened?
There was just the drones,

1896
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,908
and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.

1897
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:28,263
Was that you?
Yeah.

1898
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:30,688
Did you get him?

1899
01:49:34,075 --> 01:49:35,737
Yeah.
Well, I...

1900
01:49:37,071 --> 01:49:38,152
brought that.

1901
01:49:39,243 --> 01:49:40,814
In case you needed some help.

1902
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:42,366
Thanks.

1903
01:49:44,679 --> 01:49:45,534
Anyway,

1904
01:49:46,676 --> 01:49:49,159
there was this sweaty
guy in the tower with us.

1905
01:49:49,161 --> 01:49:51,311
I think he works for you or something.

1906
01:49:51,837 --> 01:49:52,555
He...

1907
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:54,359
He gave me this.

1908
01:49:56,138 --> 01:49:56,911
No.

1909
01:49:58,438 --> 01:50:00,026
MJ, I'm so sorry.

1910
01:50:00,028 --> 01:50:01,984
I had this plan, this stupid plan.
Peter.

1911
01:50:02,101 --> 01:50:05,225
I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this
and give it to you in Paris at the top...

1912
01:50:09,394 --> 01:50:10,726
And you kissed me.

1913
01:50:10,878 --> 01:50:12,457
What? What?
Yeah.

1914
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:14,733
I don't really have,

1915
01:50:14,735 --> 01:50:17,725
much luck when it comes
to getting close to people.

1916
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:21,048
So I lied.

1917
01:50:23,266 --> 01:50:25,792
I wasn't just watching you
because I thought you were...

1918
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:27,204
Spider-Man.

1919
01:50:31,752 --> 01:50:32,783
That's great.

1920
01:50:34,631 --> 01:50:35,518
Black dahlia,

1921
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,045
like the murder.
The murder.

1922
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:37,943
Good.
Yeah.

1923
01:50:39,414 --> 01:50:40,514
Sorry it's broken.

1924
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:43,068
I actually like it better broken.

1925
01:50:45,215 --> 01:50:46,331
I really like you.

1926
01:50:48,105 --> 01:50:49,596
I really like you too.

1927
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:05,383
Ok. I should...

1928
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:08,535
I should probably get back
to the class.

1929
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,620
I'll go and...

1930
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:12,659
Yeah. I don't know.
Ok.

1931
01:51:15,209 --> 01:51:16,174
Just in case.

1932
01:51:23,969 --> 01:51:25,155
Yeah, no.

1933
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:26,599
No, May, you're right.

1934
01:51:26,601 --> 01:51:28,447
He did great. He was strong.

1935
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:30,932
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1936
01:51:31,322 --> 01:51:32,337
I got to go.

1937
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:35,117
I'm glad you're alive.

1938
01:51:35,526 --> 01:51:36,810
I guess the coded message worked.

1939
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:38,785
Appearances can be deceiving.

1940
01:51:39,998 --> 01:51:42,013
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1941
01:51:42,184 --> 01:51:42,950
It worked.

1942
01:51:43,148 --> 01:51:45,939
Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.

1943
01:51:46,009 --> 01:51:47,625
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1944
01:51:51,163 --> 01:51:52,163
Where's Parker?

1945
01:51:52,772 --> 01:51:53,579
He's with a girl.

1946
01:51:53,737 --> 01:51:56,016
I need to speak with him.

1947
01:51:57,085 --> 01:51:58,997
He'll call you.
He'll...?

1948
01:52:03,386 --> 01:52:04,100
Ok.

1949
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:05,255
Great.

1950
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:06,685
Well, he better.

1951
01:52:07,314 --> 01:52:08,522
Or it's your ass.

1952
01:52:09,929 --> 01:52:12,736
And don't even think about ghosting me.

1953
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,825
Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?

1954
01:52:32,076 --> 01:52:35,344
Yeah, I mean it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1955
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:38,517
Except for me.

1956
01:52:39,021 --> 01:52:40,021
Thanks.

1957
01:52:40,361 --> 01:52:41,752
Don't be late.
I won't.

1958
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:42,699
See you later.

1959
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:45,498
You guys are so cute.
Thanks.

1960
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:48,879
I was thinking that,
maybe we should all,

1961
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:51,075
I don't know, like go on a
double date or something.

1962
01:52:52,148 --> 01:52:53,311
We broke up.
We broke up.

1963
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,007
No. What? Why?

1964
01:52:55,194 --> 01:52:56,889
Men and women grow apart,

1965
01:52:57,612 --> 01:52:59,295
but the journey they share together,

1966
01:52:59,297 --> 01:53:00,661
will always be a part of them.

1967
01:53:02,328 --> 01:53:04,320
You are so wise.
Thank you.

1968
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:08,572
Hello, Gerald.

1969
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:11,399
Could Mother not make it?

1970
01:53:18,031 --> 01:53:18,974
May!
I promise you...

1971
01:53:19,610 --> 01:53:21,401
He's here. Don't give me a ticket.

1972
01:53:24,006 --> 01:53:25,403
I'm so glad you're ok.

1973
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:28,196
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really...

1974
01:53:28,506 --> 01:53:29,050
fine.

1975
01:53:29,382 --> 01:53:30,797
Let's go. Where are your bags?

1976
01:53:31,361 --> 01:53:32,924
Right. They got blown up.
Yeah.

1977
01:53:34,439 --> 01:53:36,557
I got you some hot buttered bagels.
Thank you so much.

1978
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:37,554
I know my boy.

1979
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:40,901
I kept my identity pretty guarded
these past couple years.

1980
01:53:41,316 --> 01:53:42,813
I faced a lot of deception.

1981
01:53:42,899 --> 01:53:45,501
And I'm tired of the lies.

1982
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:47,813
So it's time for the truth to be out there.

1983
01:53:51,243 --> 01:53:52,279
Are you dating?

1984
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:54,450
Yes.
Not really.

1985
01:53:55,454 --> 01:53:57,241
What?
Well...

1986
01:53:57,331 --> 01:53:59,288
I think...
Summer fling.

1987
01:53:59,506 --> 01:54:01,737
Yes, that evolves and grows like...

1988
01:54:01,739 --> 01:54:03,411
any other open...
I still don't know where it's going to go.

1989
01:54:03,412 --> 01:54:04,712
To wherever it might lead.

1990
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:05,427
Anywhere.

1991
01:54:05,429 --> 01:54:07,379
And to share it with people.
On or off. We'll always

1992
01:54:07,381 --> 01:54:08,497
be friends no matter what.

1993
01:54:08,558 --> 01:54:10,934
I'm gonna go because I've got a date.

1994
01:54:10,936 --> 01:54:13,912
Because we all are interconnected.

1995
01:54:13,914 --> 01:54:14,676
Bye.
We are.

1996
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:34,399
Sorry!

1997
01:55:11,592 --> 01:55:12,916
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Hey.

1998
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,197
It's fine.
You ready?

1999
01:55:15,283 --> 01:55:16,945
Yeah.
You're gonna love this.

2000
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:18,901
Ok! Ok!

2001
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:20,827
Ok. Ok.
You ready?

2002
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:24,123
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch. I'm not gonna watch.

2003
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:28,791
I should stop looking.
I'm gonna stop looking! Hey!

Let's just...

2009
01:57:58,335 --> 01:57:59,895
Never, never doing that again.

2010
01:57:59,933 --> 01:58:01,737
I'm never doing that again.
Ok.

2011
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:03,393
Well, I should probably get out of here.

2012

Be safe.
See you later.

It was fine.

2043

We helped.

02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:42,027
Talos.
Come off it.

2046
02:07:42,113 --> 02:07:44,488
How was I supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake?

2047
02:07:44,813 --> 02:07:47,282
I mean, that was all very,
very convincing. You know.

2048
02:07:47,284 --> 02:07:50,691
The performances, the illusion,
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

2049
02:07:50,872 --> 02:07:54,081
I mean, this is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

Hey there.
I hope your mission is going well.

2051
02:07:59,464 --> 02:08:02,919
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

2052
02:08:03,131 --> 02:08:04,051
And...

2053
02:08:04,828 --> 02:08:06,469
it was very touching, you know?

2054
02:08:06,678 --> 02:08:08,341
Really, really quite touching.

2055
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:09,399
Talos.

2056
02:08:09,862 --> 02:08:10,954
And...

2057
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:13,396
yea... shortly after that,

2058
02:08:14,452 --> 02:08:17,327
it really kind of went off the rails,
and so we need you to come back

2059

because everyone kept asking
me where the Avengers are,

2060
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:20,933
I don't know what to say to that,
