00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,571
That is good to know,

171
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,573
I will plan my toga party accordingly.

172
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,412
Where you going?

173
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,663
Your father's flying us

174
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,082
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.

175
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,742
We might have to make a quick stop.

176
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,998
At the Pentagon. Right?

177
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,172
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.

178

They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.

179
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,006
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.

180
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,512
I'll get the bags.

He does miss you when you're not here.

182
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,438
And frankly, you're going to miss us.

183
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,857
Because this is the last time

184
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,525
we're all going to be together.

185
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,813
You know what's about to happen.

186
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,777
Say something.

187
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,950
If you don't, you'll regret it.

188
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,114
I love you, Dad.

189
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,534
And I know you did the best you could.

190
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,351
That's how I wish it happened.

It doesn't change the fact

200
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,500
that they never made it to the airport...

would've ever funded it.

That was nice,
what you did for those young people.

Ah, they deserve it.

it's not S.H.l.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.

478
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,216
No, but it's run by people

479
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,673
with agendas, and agendas change.

480
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,682
That's good. That's why I'm here.

481
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,352
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...

482
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,929
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

483
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,515
Tony, you chose to do that.

484
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,522
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

485

What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

We may not be perfect,

but the safest hands are still our own.

If we don't do this now,

491
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,327
it's gonna be done to us later.

492
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,413
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

493
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,747
You're saying they'll come for me.

It's nobody's fault.

I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

878
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,368
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

879
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,362
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

880
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,873
and then Ultron. My fault.

881
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,252
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

882
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,788
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.

883
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,212
I don't wanna lose her.

884
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,002
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

885
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,803
In her defence, I'm a handful.

886

Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,

890
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,732
Oh, really? You two knew each other?

891
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,188
He never mentioned that.

892
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,982
Maybe only a thousand times.

893

a very polite person.

896

Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.

903
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,601
But I don't wanna see you gone.

904

912

Once we put out the PR fire,

913
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,377
those documents can be amended.

914
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,262
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

915

Wanda? What about Wanda?

916
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,136
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

Is that how you see this?

925
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,775
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

- Oh, come on, Tony.

01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,189
It's about time we met.

1147
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,987
You've been getting my emails, right?

1148
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,780
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

1149
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:32,982
Regarding the...

1150
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,066
You didn't even tell me about the grant.

1151
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:35,735
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.

1152
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:36,868
- Right.
- Yeah.

1153
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:37,945
Remember when you applied?

1154
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,117
Yeah.

1155
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,783
I approved, so now we're in business.

1156
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,376
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1157
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:45,585
You keeping secrets from me now?

1158
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:49,586
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...

1159
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:51,751
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1160
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:52,918
That's what I'm here to hash out.

1161
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,462
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

1162
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,173
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someones aunt.

1163
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,592
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?

1164
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,223
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

1165
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,763
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.

1166
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,729
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

1167
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:09,144
TONY: Yeah, it's pretty well funded.

1168
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,398
Yeah? Wow.

1169
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:12,104
Look who you're talking to.

1170
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,319
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.

1171
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:23,537
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1172
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,624
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

1173
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,580
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

1174
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,665
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?

1175
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:32,966
Yeah, I was...

1176
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,510
Anyway, look, um,

1177
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,132
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1178
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,925
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.

1179
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,508
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

1180
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,810
That's you, right?

1181
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,179
Um, no.

1182
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:46,814
-(STAMMERS) What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1183
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,433
Look at you go.

1184
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,729
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

1185
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,648
That's not easy. You got mad skills.

1186
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,741
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

1187
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,318
That's where you found that?

1188
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,532
Because you know that's all fake.

1189
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:01,612
It's all done on the computer.

1190
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:02,909
Mmm-hmm.

1191
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,082
It's like that video. What is it?

1192
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,039
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1193
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:08,123
Exactly.

1194
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,832
Oh, what have we here?

1195
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,923
- Uh...
-(CLATTERS)

1196
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:15,341
(EXHALES)

1197
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,806
You're the Spider-ling.

1198
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,842
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1199
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,271
Spider-Man.

1200
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,481
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1201
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,938
It's not a onesie.

1202
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,649
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

1203
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,526
a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1204
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,863
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

1205
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,112
and Algebra test, nailed it.

1206
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,372
Who else knows? Anybody?

1207
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,075
Nobody.

1208
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,452
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1209
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,916
No. No.

1210
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,673
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

1211
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,550
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1212
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,757
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1213
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,507
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1214
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:03,966
Who manufactured that?

1215
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,475
I did.

1216
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,145
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

1217
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,556
Adhesive gloves?

1218
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,019
It's a long story. I was...

1219
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,859
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1220
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,019
Yes, I can.

1221
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,357
I'm blind!

1222
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,906
I can see in those.

1223
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:19,906
Okay?

1224
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,409
It's just that when whatever
happened,happened“.

1225
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,782
It's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.

1226
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:29,622
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

1227
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,206
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1228
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,664
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1229
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:35,873
That's why I'm here.

1230
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:39,918
Why you doing this?

1231
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,509
I gotta know, what's your MO?

1232
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:43,931
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

1233
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,349
Because“.

1234
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:48,768
(STAMMERS)

1235
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,355
Because I've been me my whole life,

1236
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,104
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1237
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,730
Mmm-hmm.

1238
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,187
I read books, I build computers.

1239
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,070
Yeah, I would love to play football,

1240
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,696
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1241
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,444
Sure, because you're different.

1242
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,535
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1243
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:16,543
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1244
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,085
and then the bad things happen...

1245
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,462
they happen because of you.

1246
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,727
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1247
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,105
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

1248
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:35,896
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

1249
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,485
That's what it is.

1250
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,907
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

1251

(TONY EXHALES)

1252
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,046
You got a passport?

1253
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,499
No, I don't even have a driver's license.

1254
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,133
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

1255
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,209
Oh, you'll love it.

1256
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,341
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

1257
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,014
I got homework.

1258
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,597
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1259
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,720
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1260
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,020
Might be a little dangerous.

1261
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:15,939
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1262
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,652
Don't tell Aunt May.

1263
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,570
All right, Spider-Man.

1264
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,408
Get me out of this.

01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,615

Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

1272
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,561
Disappointing my kids.

I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

the consequences of your actions.

you can go to high school.

If you do this...

they will never stop being afraid of you.

1302

I can't control their fear, only my own.
