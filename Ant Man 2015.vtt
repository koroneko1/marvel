HANK: Stark!

00:21.360 --> 00:22.600
HOWARD: He doesn't seem happy.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.045
Hello, Hank.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.370
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.204
I took a detour...

00:30.280 --> 00:32.408
Through your defense lab.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.481
Tell me that isn't what
I think it is.

00:35.560 --> 00:39.610
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.968
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.565
You were instructed to go to Russia.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.642
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

00:46.720 --> 00:47.846
I'm a scientist.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.570
Then act like one.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.240
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.406
Help us put it to good use.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.881
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

00:55.960 --> 00:57.883
and now you try to steal my research?

00:57.960 --> 01:02.284
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.886
Ah...

01:07.000 --> 01:08.968
- (GROANS)
- Easy, Hank.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.971
You mention my wife again

01:13.040 --> 01:15.088
and I'll show you ferocity.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.764
Don't look at me. You said it.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.161
I formally tender my resignation.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.561
We don't accept it. Formally.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.926
Hank,

01:24.000 --> 01:25.729
we need you.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.121
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.521
Don't let your past determine the future.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.524
As long as I am alive,

01:33.600 --> 01:37.082
nobody will ever get that formula.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.762
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.047
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.645
Yes.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.724
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.888
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.840
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

01:58.560 --> 02:00.130
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.690
He's no security risk.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.604

Dr. Hank Pym.

When I took over this company

I immediately started
researching a particle

the distance between atoms,

10:55.920 --> 10:58.764

Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.683
But just imagine,

11:08.760 --> 11:13.004

11:57.400 --> 11:59.880
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

11:59.960 --> 12:01.610
Just a tall tale.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.727
Right.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.883
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

12:16.320 --> 12:19.927
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.844
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

12:22.920 --> 12:25.969
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

12:26.840 --> 12:28.444
Could that be done?

42:23.360 --> 42:25.488
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

42:25.560 --> 42:27.210
and can I go back to jail now?

42:27.280 --> 42:28.691
Come with me.

42:29.320 --> 42:33.450
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.726
SCOTT: Huh?

42:34.800 --> 42:37.041
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

42:37.120 --> 42:38.849
That's what powers the suit.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.604
That's why it works.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.801
SCOTT: Wow.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.243
(MACHINERY POWERING UP)

42:48.200 --> 42:49.804
- Whoa!
- But it was dangerous.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.562
It was too dangerous.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.768
So I hid it from the world.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.570
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

43:00.480 --> 43:01.561
Pym Tech.

43:01.680 --> 43:02.806
Yes.

43:03.760 --> 43:07.560
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

43:07.640 --> 43:08.880
SCOTT: Darren Cross.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.007
He's a big deal.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.560
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

43:12.640 --> 43:16.964
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

43:17.040 --> 43:19.361
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

43:19.440 --> 43:23.001
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.761
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

43:26.840 --> 43:30.049
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.607
But I wouldn't help him.

43:31.680 --> 43:35.526
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

43:35.600 --> 43:37.125
How could he do that?

43:37.200 --> 43:40.010
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.411
She was the deciding vote.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.005
But she came back to me

43:45.080 --> 43:48.448
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.761
The process is highly volatile.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.684
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

43:54.760 --> 43:57.650
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.681
I don't think Darren realizes this,

44:00.760 --> 44:03.604
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.442
So, what do you want from me?

44:08.520 --> 44:12.206
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

44:12.280 --> 44:13.281
Do you?

44:13.360 --> 44:14.805
I do.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.970
If you can help me,

44:17.040 --> 44:20.761
I promise I can help you be
with your daughter again.

44:21.800 --> 44:24.167
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

44:24.760 --> 44:25.841
Absolutely.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.686
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.125
What do you want me to do?

44:32.200 --> 44:35.602
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.449
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.165
I just want your daddy to be safe.

This isn't the first time these guys

45:47.240 --> 45:50.050
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

45:50.120 --> 45:54.170
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

45:54.240 --> 45:56.607
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

45:57.160 --> 45:59.049
He always wanted my tech.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.442
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

46:02.520 --> 46:04.648
and destroy all the data,

46:05.320 --> 46:10.690
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

46:13.080 --> 46:17.165
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.366
(HANK SCOFFS)

46:18.480 --> 46:20.244
I spent half my life

46:20.320 --> 46:23.483
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

46:23.560 --> 46:27.326
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

46:27.400 --> 46:30.802
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.406
This could change the texture of reality.

46:35.360 --> 46:39.410
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.963
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

46:42.640 --> 46:44.768
Scott, they are ants.

46:44.840 --> 46:48.765
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

46:49.840 --> 46:54.687
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

46:54.760 --> 46:58.367
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean,
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.522
He's right, Hank.
And you know it.

47:00.600 --> 47:03.206
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.330
I was against using him
when we had months,

47:05.400 --> 47:07.368

and there's just disappointment.

It's about saving theirs.

Damn. That was a good speech.

Scott,

49:16.240 --> 49:20.040
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.486
In the right hands,

49:24.560 --> 49:27.848
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

49:27.920 --> 49:31.686
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.604
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

49:34.680 --> 49:35.886
you need to be fast.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.883
You should be able to shrink and grow

49:37.960 --> 49:39.166

49:39.760 --> 49:43.082
So your size always suits your needs.

50:01.400 --> 50:02.845
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

50:02.920 --> 50:04.843
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.165

you have to know how to punch.

you won't tell me how she died.

is holding me back.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.725
Do not screw with the regulator.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.564
If that regulator is compromised,

50:59.640 --> 51:01.210
you would go subatomic.

51:01.280 --> 51:02.645
What does that mean?

51:03.720 --> 51:05.882
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.411
What does that mean?

51:07.480 --> 51:12.008
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

51:12.080 --> 51:13.127
become irrelevant

51:13.200 --> 51:16.044
as you shrink for all eternity.

55:22.440 --> 55:23.521
Oh, God.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.568
You gotta lock your doors.

55:25.640 --> 55:28.530
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.284
Do you think this is a joke?

55:31.320 --> 55:33.846
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

55:33.920 --> 55:35.160
You have a daughter.

55:35.240 --> 55:36.571
I'm doing this for her.

55:36.640 --> 55:39.610
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

55:40.360 --> 55:41.360
He was in grief.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.805
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

55:42.880 --> 55:45.486
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.283
He just sent me off to boarding school.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.601
You know, I thought,

55:51.440 --> 55:52.805
with all that's at stake,

55:52.880 --> 55:56.043
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

55:56.120 --> 55:58.043
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

55:58.120 --> 56:01.010
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.445
Then why are you here?

56:02.520 --> 56:04.522
It proves that he loves you.

56:05.920 --> 56:08.207
Hope. Look at me.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.130
I'm expendable.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.205
That's why I'm here.

56:14.360 --> 56:16.203
You must have realized that by now.

56:17.080 --> 56:19.287
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.527
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

56:25.440 --> 56:26.487
Anyway...

56:27.800 --> 56:30.963
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

56:31.040 --> 56:33.281
when I called the cops on you.

56:37.320 --> 56:38.481
What's her name?

56:39.320 --> 56:40.810
Cassie.

56:41.560 --> 56:43.324
It's a pretty name.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.564
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.608
That's how it works.

56:52.760 --> 56:54.171
Think about Cassie.

56:54.240 --> 56:58.165
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.689
Open your eyes

57:08.760 --> 57:11.127
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

57:33.960 --> 57:35.200
That's good!

57:53.080 --> 57:55.970
Your mother convinced me

57:56.040 --> 57:59.123
to let her join me on my missions.

57:59.640 --> 58:01.802
They called her the Wasp.

58:01.880 --> 58:04.121
She was born to it.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.728
And there's not a day that goes by

58:08.600 --> 58:11.604
that I don't regret having said yes.

58:16.080 --> 58:17.764
It was 1987.

58:18.560 --> 58:23.043
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

58:24.600 --> 58:27.570
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

58:34.960 --> 58:38.169
<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

58:38.240 --> 58:40.163
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

58:49.440 --> 58:54.162
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

58:54.240 --> 58:57.483
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

58:59.200 --> 59:00.645
<i>Your mother,</i>

59:00.720 --> 59:02.085
<i>she didn't hesitate.</i>

59:04.240 --> 59:05.844
Janet! No!

59:12.600 --> 59:15.080
She turned off her regulator

59:15.840 --> 59:17.569
and went subatomic

59:19.040 --> 59:21.168
to deactivate the bomb.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.769
And she was gone.

59:29.200 --> 59:31.328
Your mom died a hero.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.321
And I spent the next 10 years

59:36.440 --> 59:40.764
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.448
You were trying to bring her back.

59:48.080 --> 59:51.687
But all I learned was we know nothing.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.523
It's not your fault.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.364
She made her choice.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.526
(VOICE BREAKING)
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.570
I was trying to protect you.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.050
I lost your mother.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.925
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.125
I'm sorry.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.766
This is awesome.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.524
It's awesome, you know?

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.682
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.205
It's important.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.610
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.409
Yes, you did. Yes.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.483
I'm going to make some tea.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.201
Nailed it!

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.488
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.243
HANK: <i>The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.</i>

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.481
SCOTT: It's freezing!

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.927
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.491
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.291
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.044
HOPE: We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.009
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.010
It's currently collecting dust

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.209
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.248
<i>Should be a piece of cake.</i>

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.203
You're over the target area.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.607
Disengage now, Scott!

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.841
Squadron A, go!

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.251
B, go!

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.761
C, go!

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.251
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.402
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.527
Stay calm.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.249
SCOTT: Guys?
We might have a problem.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.767
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.887
It's not!

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.163
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.369
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.521
<i>Abort now!</i>

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.331
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.488
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.441
He's gonna lose the suit.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.010
He's gonna lose his life.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.001
(GRUNTS)

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.968
<i>All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.</i>

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.690
Somebody's home, Scott.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.171
MAN:
<i>What's going on down there, Sam?</i>

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.366
SCOTT: It's the Falcon!

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.168
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.721
Wait a second.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.808
HANK: Abort, Scott! Abort now!

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.405
It's okay. He can't see me.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.527
I can see you.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.761
He can see me.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.043
Hi. I'm Scott.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.770
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.128
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I'm a big fan.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.850
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.841
I'm Ant-Man.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.160
"Ant-Man"?

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.362
What? You haven't heard of me?

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.204
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.045
You wanna tell me what you want?

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.561
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.369
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.091
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.571
I know exactly how that is.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.527
Located the breach.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.080
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.085
What the hell are you doing?

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.760
FALCON: Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.126
SCOTT: Sorry!

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.730
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.481
That's enough!

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.607
Sorry!

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.520
You seem like a really great guy.

(GRUNTING)

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.360
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.167
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.081
You jeopardized everything!

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.644
You got it.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.641
Well done.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.720
SCOTT: Wait a minute.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.171
Did you just compliment me?

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.720
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.800
Let us not dwell on the past.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.008
We gotta finish our planning.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.044
HOPE: Don't mind him.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.561
You did good.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.726
Darren.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.370
How the hell did you get in here?

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.841
You left the front door open, Hank.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.240
It's official.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.441
You're old.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.161
The plans.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.164
He will kill him.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.085
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.610
I have good news.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.920
Really?

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.761
What's that?

Pym Tech, the company you created,

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.880
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.726
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.446
You're welcome.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.280
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.962
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.770
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.126
I'll be there.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.645
What did you see in me?

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.251
I don't know what you mean.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.766
All those years ago, you picked me.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.330
What did you see?

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.284
I saw myself.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.281
Then why did you push me away?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.162
Because I saw too much of myself.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.451
HOPE: <i>He knows. He's baiting you.</i>

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.249
We have to call it off.

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:32.481
We're all taking risks.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.890
What if he saw me here?

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.291
He didn't. There's no way.

- How do you know that?

Darren, hi.

Hope, where are you right now?

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.246
I'm at home. Why?

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:53.084
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.969
<i>I still get nothing but contempt from him.</i>

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.600
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.126
<i>We need to start everyone working
around the clock.</i>

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.049
<i>Get the assembly line up and running.</i>

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.406
<i>And I'm tripling security.</i>

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.482
Full sensors at all entrances

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.962
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.684
Great. Good idea.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.084
<i>Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.</i>

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.002
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.048
But he is not onto you.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.487
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.328
