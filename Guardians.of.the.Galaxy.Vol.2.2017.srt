819
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,677
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

820
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,833
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

821
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,833
That's enough killing for today.

824

TASERFACE: I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

825
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,873
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

826
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,669
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,833
I assure you...

829
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,833
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

830
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,831
or a talking woodland beast.

831
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,071
I want 10% of the take...

832
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,518
and a couple more things.

833

You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,752
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

837
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,356
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

839
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,669
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

840
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,956
What are you gonna do with your share?

841
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,155
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

842
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,077
battle one another in training.

843
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,189
Every time my sister prevailed...

844
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,670
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

845
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,513
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

846
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,431
But she won...

847
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,435
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

848
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,389
So after I murder my sister...

849
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,709
I will buy a warship

850
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,791
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

851
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,589
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

852
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,193
piece by piece...

853
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,750
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

854
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,037
I know every single day.

855
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,273
Yeah.

856
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,520
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

857
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,231
Or a nice hat.

858
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,119
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

859
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,277
Anyways, happy trails.

860
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,516
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

861
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,794
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.

862
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,995
Peter...

863
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,056
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

864
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,479
But you left...

865

866
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,119
to die alone.

867
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,710
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

868
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,030
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

869
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,593
and the light within it...

870
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,318
this form will wither and perish.

871
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,520
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

872
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,551
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

873
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,956
I loved your mother, Peter!

874
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,475
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

875
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,473
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

876
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,029
I know exactly what that feels like!

877
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,952
I had to watch her die!

878
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,472
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

879
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,108
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

880
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,155
But you're not one of them.

881
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,709
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

teach you about this planet...

886
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,351

887

Here.

888
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,237
Hold them like that.

889
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,038
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

was adhere to the code.

she's afraid of something.

He's my father. He's blood.

1152

You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

1153
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,076
Again, you made me come here!

And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

No, it's because that place is real,

Oh, I get it. You're jealous...

1159
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,189
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

I think I shall call him...

1948
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:02,719
Adam.

1949
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,558
(THE SNEEPERS
FT. DAVID HASSELHOFF'S

"GUARDIANS INFERNO" PLAYING)

1951
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,153
Ugh, dude.

1952
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:08,712
Seriously?

1953
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,880
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

1954
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,359
I am Groot.

1955
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,471
I am not boring. You're boring.

1956
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,470
You know what's boring?

1957
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,791
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1958
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,555
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

1959
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,308
I'm not boring!

1960
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,480
I am Groot.

1961
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,628
And now I know how Yondu felt.

HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...

1963
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,836
just remember...

1964
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:15,519
We. Are. Groot.

1965
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,994
Hey, fellas.

1966
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,832
Wait, where are you going?

1967
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,355
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1968
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,192
How will I get out of here?

1969
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,679
Hey! Aw, gee...

1970
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,479
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1971
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:31,874
Aw, guys.

1972
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,349
Oh, gee...
