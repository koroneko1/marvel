01:14.303 --> 01:15.827
Are you the guys from Washington?

01:15.938 --> 01:17.735
You get many other visitors out here?

01:17.840 --> 01:19.398
How long you been on-site?

01:19.508 --> 01:20.873
Since this morning.

01:20.976 --> 01:23.604
A Russian oil team
called it in about 18 hours ago.

01:23.846 --> 01:26.212
How come nobody spotted it before?

01:26.315 --> 01:28.010
It's really not that surprising.

01:28.484 --> 01:30.611
This landscape's changing all the time.

01:30.719 --> 01:32.550
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

01:32.654 --> 01:34.713
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

01:34.823 --> 01:36.154
I don't think so.

01:36.258 --> 01:38.283
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

01:38.627 --> 01:41.027
How long before
we can start craning it out?

01:41.330 --> 01:43.025
I don't think you quite understand.

01:43.398 --> 01:46.060
You guys are gonna need
one hell of a crane.

02:32.614 --> 02:34.582
<i>Base, we're in.</i>

02:40.689 --> 02:41.986
<i>What is this?</i>

02:57.306 --> 02:58.432
<i>Careful.</i>

03:19.328 --> 03:20.625
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

03:23.732 --> 03:25.029
<i>What is it?</i>

03:25.400 --> 03:26.697
<i>My God.</i>

03:27.002 --> 03:29.470
<i>Base, get me a line to the Colonel.</i>

03:30.205 --> 03:31.638
<i>It's 3:00 a.m., sir.</i>

03:31.740 --> 03:36.302
<i>I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.</i>

04:48.250 --> 04:49.239
Open it!

04:51.153 --> 04:52.711
Quickly, before he...

05:04.766 --> 05:08.566
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

05:11.106 --> 05:12.835
You should be commended.

05:12.941 --> 05:13.930
Help him up.

05:18.447 --> 05:21.848
I think that you are
a man of great vision.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.380
And, in this way, we are much alike.

05:24.486 --> 05:25.919
I am nothing like you.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.545
No, of course, but

05:28.223 --> 05:33.183
what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

05:33.762 --> 05:35.559
What you seek is just a legend.

05:35.664 --> 05:38.189
Then why make such an effort
to conceal it?

05:58.587 --> 06:03.388
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

06:08.463 --> 06:11.091
It is not something one buries.

06:11.833 --> 06:15.894
But I think it is close, yes?

06:16.671 --> 06:17.968
I cannot help you.

06:18.273 --> 06:22.676
No. But maybe
you can help your village.

06:23.078 --> 06:28.038
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

06:28.784 --> 06:31.150
I have no need for them to die.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.891
Yggdrasil.

06:47.702 --> 06:50.170
Tree of the world.

06:52.007 --> 06:54.134
Guardian of wisdom.

06:56.111 --> 06:58.079
And fate, also.

07:29.077 --> 07:33.707
<i>And the Führer digs for trinkets
in the desert.</i>

07:37.152 --> 07:40.121
You have never seen this, have you?

07:40.555 --> 07:44.184
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

07:44.426 --> 07:45.893
Exactly.

07:49.264 --> 07:51.391
Give the order to open fire.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.765
Fool!

07:54.402 --> 07:56.700
You cannot control the power you hold.

07:56.805 --> 07:57.829
You will burn!

07:58.940 --> 08:00.669
I already have.

08:13.121 --> 08:15.089
<i>O'Connell, Michael.</i>

08:15.924 --> 08:17.949
Kaminsky, Henry.

08:18.293 --> 08:20.284
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

08:20.595 --> 08:22.222
Rogers, Steven.

08:23.298 --> 08:26.096
It kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting, huh?

08:26.635 --> 08:27.761
Nope.

08:30.739 --> 08:32.206
Rogers.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.040
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.

08:41.917 --> 08:45.080
He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping I could be assigned...

08:45.186 --> 08:47.882
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.

08:48.089 --> 08:50.080
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

08:54.663 --> 08:56.688
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.

08:56.798 --> 08:59.358
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

08:59.834 --> 09:00.858
Is there anything you can do?

09:01.369 --> 09:02.666
I'm doing it.

09:03.104 --> 09:04.366
I'm saving your life.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.878
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

09:11.913 --> 09:13.881
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

09:14.649 --> 09:19.279
<i>Every able-bodied young man is
lining up to serve his country.</i>

09:22.190 --> 09:24.886
<i>Even little Timmy is doing his part</i>

09:25.026 --> 09:26.994
<i>collecting scrap metal.</i>

09:27.228 --> 09:28.217
<i>Nice work, Timmy!</i>

09:28.330 --> 09:29.592
Who cares?

09:30.765 --> 09:32.357
Play the movie already!

09:32.467 --> 09:34.162
Hey, you wanna show some respect?

09:34.436 --> 09:35.630
<i>Meanwhile, overseas,</i>

09:35.737 --> 09:38.797
<i>our brave boys are showing
the Axis powers that the price</i>

09:38.907 --> 09:40.636
<i>of freedom is never too high.</i>

09:40.742 --> 09:43.040
Let's go! Get on with it!

09:43.979 --> 09:45.708
Hey, just start the cartoon!

09:45.814 --> 09:46.940
Hey, you wanna shut up?

09:47.882 --> 09:50.510
<i>Together with Allied forces,
we'll face any threat,</i>

09:50.618 --> 09:51.949
<i>no matter the size.</i>

10:09.404 --> 10:11.167
You just don't know when to give up,
do you?

10:11.906 --> 10:13.703
I can do this all day.

10:18.113 --> 10:19.341
Hey!

10:19.447 --> 10:20.914
Pick on someone your own size.

10:29.157 --> 10:32.126
Sometimes I think
you like getting punched.

10:32.827 --> 10:34.454
I had him on the ropes.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.695
How many times is this?

10:37.932 --> 10:40.059
You're from Paramus now?

10:40.335 --> 10:43.065
You know it's illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

10:43.171 --> 10:44.638
And seriously, Jersey?

10:46.474 --> 10:47.873
You get your orders?

10:50.478 --> 10:51.536
The 107th.

10:51.946 --> 10:53.345
Sergeant James Barnes,

10:53.448 --> 10:55.814
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.812
I should be going.

11:04.426 --> 11:05.415
Come on, man.

11:06.194 --> 11:09.095
My last night!
I got to get you cleaned up.

11:09.197 --> 11:10.721
Why? Where are we going?

11:10.865 --> 11:12.162
The future.

11:17.038 --> 11:19.063
I don't see what the problem is.

11:19.174 --> 11:21.768
You're about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

11:22.043 --> 11:24.375
You know there's
three and a half million women here?

11:24.479 --> 11:25.707
Well, I'd settle for just one.

11:26.714 --> 11:28.147
Good thing I took care of that.

11:28.783 --> 11:29.841
Hey, Bucky!

11:32.187 --> 11:34.246
What'd you tell her about me?

11:34.489 --> 11:36.320
Only the good stuff.

11:37.525 --> 11:40.585
<i>Welcome to
the Modern Marvels Pavilion</i>

11:40.695 --> 11:43.323
<i>and the World of Tomorrow.</i>

11:43.832 --> 11:47.632
<i>A greater world. A better world.</i>

11:50.905 --> 11:53.465
Oh, my God! It's starting!

11:55.743 --> 11:58.303
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Howard Stark!</i>

12:08.189 --> 12:10.555
I love you, Howard!

12:12.861 --> 12:14.726
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

12:15.029 --> 12:19.659
<i>what if I told you that in just
a few short years, your automobile</i>

12:19.934 --> 12:22.835
<i>won't even have to
touch the ground at all?</i>

12:24.606 --> 12:26.972
<i>Yes. Thanks, Mandy.</i>

12:27.075 --> 12:29.373
<i>With Stark Gravitic
Reversion Technology</i>

12:29.777 --> 12:31.642
<i>you'll be able to do just that.</i>

12:39.988 --> 12:41.250
Holy cow.

12:53.668 --> 12:55.727
<i>I did say a few years, didn't I?</i>

13:04.345 --> 13:07.644
Hey, Steve, what do you say
we treat these girls...

13:16.457 --> 13:18.254
Come on, soldier.

13:23.198 --> 13:25.325
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

13:25.433 --> 13:26.900
We're taking the girls dancing.

13:27.001 --> 13:29.026
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

13:32.006 --> 13:33.997
You're really going to do this again?

13:34.108 --> 13:35.598
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.

13:35.710 --> 13:37.405
As who, Steve from Ohio?

13:37.512 --> 13:39.844
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.

13:40.548 --> 13:41.845
Look, I know
you don't think I can do this.

13:41.950 --> 13:43.315
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

13:43.618 --> 13:45.381
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

13:45.486 --> 13:47.317
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?

13:47.422 --> 13:49.356
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

13:49.457 --> 13:51.049
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

13:51.159 --> 13:53.719
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

13:54.729 --> 13:56.856
I got no right to do any less than them.

13:56.965 --> 13:59.593
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.

14:00.068 --> 14:03.162
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.

14:06.074 --> 14:08.907
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

14:10.178 --> 14:11.941
Yes, we are.

14:17.785 --> 14:20.015
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

14:20.121 --> 14:21.145
How can I?

14:21.589 --> 14:23.454
You're taking all the stupid with you.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.788
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.259
Be careful.

14:34.636 --> 14:36.160
Don't win the war till I get there!

14:41.309 --> 14:44.210
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.

15:03.765 --> 15:04.993
Wait here.

15:06.034 --> 15:08.434
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

15:27.388 --> 15:28.685
Thank you.

15:32.527 --> 15:33.585
So,

15:34.329 --> 15:37.765
you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.

15:39.133 --> 15:40.430
Excuse me?

15:40.802 --> 15:42.394
Dr. Abraham Erskine.

15:42.503 --> 15:45.199
I represent
the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.632
Steve Rogers.

15:51.145 --> 15:52.703
Where are you from?

15:53.147 --> 15:57.277
Queens. 73rd Street
and Utopia Parkway.

15:57.752 --> 15:59.720
Before that, Germany.

16:00.755 --> 16:02.620
- This troubles you?
- No.

16:03.624 --> 16:05.751
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?

16:06.094 --> 16:07.789
Is it New Haven?

16:08.896 --> 16:10.295
Or Paramus?

16:11.332 --> 16:13.562
Five exams in five different cities.

16:13.668 --> 16:14.692
That might not be the right file.

16:14.802 --> 16:16.633
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.

16:16.738 --> 16:18.865
It's the five tries.

16:19.941 --> 16:24.071
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?

16:27.048 --> 16:28.037
Is this a test?

16:29.450 --> 16:30.747
Yes.

16:33.855 --> 16:35.482
I don't want to kill anyone.

16:36.257 --> 16:39.351
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.

16:41.129 --> 16:42.357
Well, there are already

16:42.463 --> 16:44.397
so many big men fighting this war.

16:44.665 --> 16:46.462
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

16:48.870 --> 16:50.303
I can offer you a chance.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.571
Only a chance.

16:53.674 --> 16:55.403
- I'll take it.
- Good.

16:56.644 --> 17:00.444
So where is
the little guy from? Actually?

17:01.482 --> 17:02.779
Brooklyn.

17:04.952 --> 17:07.420
Congratulations, soldier.

17:31.579 --> 17:33.706
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

17:35.183 --> 17:38.812
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

17:40.421 --> 17:42.412
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

17:42.990 --> 17:45.117
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours

17:45.226 --> 17:49.287
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

17:49.530 --> 17:50.963
With this artifact

17:51.632 --> 17:52.963
I am certain of nothing.

17:53.267 --> 17:55.633
I fear it may not work at all.

18:32.773 --> 18:33.967
Twenty percent.

18:36.210 --> 18:37.541
Forty.

18:40.248 --> 18:41.579
Sixty.

18:44.452 --> 18:46.283
Stabilizing at 70%.

18:48.489 --> 18:52.118
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

19:10.678 --> 19:12.236
What was that?

19:12.847 --> 19:15.941
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

19:16.050 --> 19:19.213
Your designs do not disappoint.

19:19.320 --> 19:23.620
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

19:24.392 --> 19:26.622
The exchange is stable.

19:27.194 --> 19:28.661
Amazing!

19:29.330 --> 19:31.355
The energy we have just collected

19:31.465 --> 19:34.400
could power my designs.
All my designs.

19:36.571 --> 19:39.369
This will change the war.

19:40.107 --> 19:41.836
Dr. Zola,

19:43.244 --> 19:46.179
this will change the world.

19:48.716 --> 19:50.581
Ready, exercise!

19:50.685 --> 19:52.448
Recruits, attention!

19:53.454 --> 19:54.978
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

19:55.356 --> 19:57.950
I supervise all operations
for this division.

19:58.359 --> 20:00.190
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

20:01.395 --> 20:03.386
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

20:03.564 --> 20:04.622
What's your name, soldier?

20:05.066 --> 20:06.727
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.529
Step forward, Hodge.

20:10.304 --> 20:11.669
Put your right foot forward.

20:13.107 --> 20:14.438
We gonna wrassle?

20:16.277 --> 20:18.643
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.

20:21.515 --> 20:22.777
Agent Carter!

20:23.150 --> 20:24.515
Colonel Phillips.

20:24.619 --> 20:27.588
I can see that you are
breaking in the candidates. That's good!

20:28.322 --> 20:29.584
Get your ass up out of that dirt

20:29.690 --> 20:32.420
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

20:32.526 --> 20:33.959
Yes, sir!

20:37.298 --> 20:39.596
General Patton has said

20:40.167 --> 20:43.796
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

20:43.904 --> 20:47.431
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

20:51.846 --> 20:54.007
And because they are
going to get better.

20:54.115 --> 20:56.083
Much better.

20:56.917 --> 21:00.648
<i>The Strategic Scientific Reserve
is an Allied effort</i>

21:00.788 --> 21:03.780
<i>made up of
the best minds in the free world.</i>

21:04.291 --> 21:07.385
<i>Our goal is
to create the best army in history.</i>

21:07.962 --> 21:09.827
<i>But every army starts with one man.</i>

21:10.264 --> 21:12.061
Rogers! Get off of there!

21:12.166 --> 21:14.259
<i>At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.</i>

21:14.835 --> 21:18.464
He will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

21:24.745 --> 21:27.111
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

21:27.214 --> 21:31.844
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

21:32.186 --> 21:34.313
Pick up the pace, ladies!

21:34.989 --> 21:38.447
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

21:38.793 --> 21:41.591
Come on! Faster! Faster!

21:42.063 --> 21:44.361
Move! Move!

21:44.732 --> 21:46.700
Squad, halt!

21:47.368 --> 21:49.598
That flag means
we're only at the halfway point.

21:50.337 --> 21:53.738
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

21:53.841 --> 21:55.536
Move, move!

21:56.510 --> 21:58.307
Come on! Get up there!

21:58.579 --> 22:01.275
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

22:01.382 --> 22:02.940
Get up there, Hodge!

22:03.250 --> 22:05.582
Come on! Get up there!

22:07.254 --> 22:09.688
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

22:11.525 --> 22:14.653
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

22:14.762 --> 22:17.026
Let's go! Get back into formation!

22:19.567 --> 22:21.762
Rogers! I said fall in!

22:38.052 --> 22:39.576
Thank you, sir.

22:48.395 --> 22:50.590
Faster, ladies! Come on.

22:50.898 --> 22:53.196
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.

22:54.668 --> 22:55.657
Move it!

22:55.770 --> 22:57.897
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

22:58.005 --> 23:00.906
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

23:01.008 --> 23:04.307
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

23:04.411 --> 23:05.810
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."

23:05.913 --> 23:07.608
Maybe he'd be useful to you,
like a gerbil.

23:07.715 --> 23:08.739
I never thought you'd pick him.

23:08.849 --> 23:10.009
Up.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.852
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.

23:14.955 --> 23:17.423
- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.

23:18.392 --> 23:19.757
He's making me cry.

23:19.860 --> 23:22.420
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

23:22.530 --> 23:25.124
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

23:25.232 --> 23:26.324
All the groveling I had to do

23:26.433 --> 23:27.593
in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?

23:27.701 --> 23:29.896
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.

23:30.004 --> 23:33.235
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

23:33.340 --> 23:35.240
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.

23:35.342 --> 23:36.775
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

23:37.044 --> 23:39.774
You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.915
You win wars with guts.

23:48.055 --> 23:49.215
Grenade!

23:53.761 --> 23:55.058
Get away!

23:55.596 --> 23:56.961
Get back!

24:04.271 --> 24:05.795
It was a dummy grenade.

24:06.907 --> 24:08.898
All clear. Back in formation.

24:13.214 --> 24:14.272
Is this a test?

24:16.050 --> 24:17.176
He's still skinny.

24:25.726 --> 24:27.387
- May I?
- Yeah.

24:30.731 --> 24:32.028
Can't sleep?

24:32.700 --> 24:34.497
I got the jitters, I guess.

24:35.069 --> 24:36.366
Me, too.

24:38.172 --> 24:39.696
Can I ask you a question?

24:39.807 --> 24:41.172
Just one?

24:43.410 --> 24:44.809
Why me?

24:47.848 --> 24:50.646
I suppose that is
the only question that matters.

24:53.854 --> 24:56.823
This is from Augsburg. My city.

24:59.526 --> 25:00.550
So many people forget

25:00.661 --> 25:03.129
that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.

25:03.864 --> 25:07.265
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

25:07.368 --> 25:10.269
They felt weak. They felt small.

25:10.371 --> 25:12.100
And then Hitler comes along
with the marching

25:12.206 --> 25:15.198
and the big show and the flags.

25:16.543 --> 25:20.536
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

25:20.648 --> 25:21.945
And he says, "You."

25:22.883 --> 25:24.646
He says, "You will make us strong."

25:25.419 --> 25:28.047
Well, I am not interested.

25:29.490 --> 25:31.822
So he sends the head of Hydra,

25:32.293 --> 25:34.261
his research division.

25:34.561 --> 25:37.189
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

25:37.464 --> 25:39.898
Now, Schmidt is
a member of the inner circle.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.297
And he is ambitious.

25:41.735 --> 25:47.002
<i>He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.</i>

25:47.775 --> 25:50.767
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

25:50.878 --> 25:52.641
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

25:53.147 --> 25:56.139
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

25:56.250 --> 25:58.775
that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,

25:58.886 --> 26:00.114
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

26:00.220 --> 26:03.018
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

26:03.590 --> 26:08.618
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.

26:11.665 --> 26:14.225
<i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i>

26:19.940 --> 26:21.032
Did it make him stronger?

26:21.275 --> 26:22.503
Yes.

26:22.943 --> 26:25.844
But there were other effects.

26:30.317 --> 26:31.443
The serum was not ready.

26:32.686 --> 26:35.655
But more important, the man.

26:36.623 --> 26:38.887
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

26:38.993 --> 26:42.121
so good becomes great.

26:42.229 --> 26:43.924
Bad becomes worse.

26:49.236 --> 26:50.828
This is why you were chosen.

26:51.972 --> 26:55.499
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

26:55.609 --> 26:57.543
may lose respect for that power,

26:57.644 --> 27:00.807
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.180
And knows

27:03.717 --> 27:05.014
compassion.

27:08.222 --> 27:10.952
Thanks. I think.

27:16.897 --> 27:19.798
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

27:23.003 --> 27:25.096
That you will stay who you are.

27:27.641 --> 27:29.609
Not a perfect soldier,

27:29.977 --> 27:30.966
but

27:31.478 --> 27:33.446
a good man.

27:38.652 --> 27:40.119
To the little guys.

27:42.756 --> 27:44.189
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

27:44.291 --> 27:46.418
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

27:47.694 --> 27:49.525
All right. We'll drink it after.

27:49.830 --> 27:53.197
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.

28:08.749 --> 28:11.582
Is there something in particular
you need?

28:17.458 --> 28:20.256
I understand you found him.

28:21.095 --> 28:22.722
See for yourself.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.365
You disapprove.

28:37.077 --> 28:40.103
I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.

28:40.214 --> 28:41.943
I can't imagine he will succeed.

28:44.985 --> 28:46.179
Again.

28:46.587 --> 28:50.580
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

28:50.691 --> 28:54.286
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

28:57.498 --> 28:59.125
Shall I give the order?

29:00.234 --> 29:02.134
It has been given.

29:04.338 --> 29:05.635
Good.

29:08.308 --> 29:09.275
Dr. Zola!

29:13.580 --> 29:14.877
What do you think?

29:21.755 --> 29:23.655
A masterpiece.

29:34.001 --> 29:35.662
I know this neighborhood.

29:36.370 --> 29:38.565
I got beat up in that alley.

29:40.207 --> 29:41.231
And that parking lot.

29:43.544 --> 29:45.444
And behind that diner.

29:45.946 --> 29:48.346
Did you have something against
running away?

29:51.084 --> 29:53.518
You start running,
they'll never let you stop.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.679
You stand up, you push back.

29:55.789 --> 29:57.086
They can't say no forever, right?

29:57.891 --> 30:01.349
I know a little of what that's like,
to have every door shut in your face.

30:02.729 --> 30:04.629
I guess I just don't know
why you'd want to join the Army

30:04.731 --> 30:06.096
if you were a beautiful dame.

30:06.300 --> 30:07.733
Or a... A woman.

30:07.935 --> 30:09.232
An agent. Not a dame.

30:09.636 --> 30:11.160
You are beautiful, but...

30:11.972 --> 30:14.167
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

30:14.741 --> 30:16.709
I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.

30:18.178 --> 30:21.705
Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

30:22.115 --> 30:23.412
You must have danced.

30:23.517 --> 30:26.179
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

30:27.254 --> 30:29.245
And the past few years, it just

30:29.356 --> 30:32.223
didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.

30:32.593 --> 30:33.787
For what?

30:35.429 --> 30:36.828
The right partner.

30:51.378 --> 30:52.777
This way.

30:56.049 --> 30:58.415
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

31:11.798 --> 31:14.460
Wonderful weather this morning,
isn't it?

31:14.568 --> 31:16.798
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

32:14.461 --> 32:15.951
Good morning.

32:17.197 --> 32:18.824
Please, not now.

32:23.670 --> 32:24.796
Are you ready?

32:26.873 --> 32:30.434
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.

32:36.149 --> 32:37.776
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

32:37.884 --> 32:39.476
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

32:39.586 --> 32:41.451
We needed access to
the city's power grid.

32:41.555 --> 32:43.682
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

32:43.790 --> 32:45.951
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

32:46.059 --> 32:47.458
This is...

32:47.561 --> 32:49.222
Fred Clemson, State Department.

32:49.329 --> 32:50.796
If this project of yours comes through,

32:50.897 --> 32:53.525
we'd like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

32:53.633 --> 32:57.364
Jesus. Somebody get that kid
a sandwich.

33:10.384 --> 33:11.442
Comfortable?

33:13.553 --> 33:14.679
It's a little big.

33:17.023 --> 33:18.581
You save me any of that schnapps?

33:19.593 --> 33:22.460
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.

33:22.863 --> 33:24.160
Next time.

33:25.232 --> 33:27.359
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

33:27.467 --> 33:29.697
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

33:29.803 --> 33:31.771
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

33:32.239 --> 33:35.037
but we are ready as we'll ever be.

33:36.042 --> 33:37.066
Agent Carter?

33:37.177 --> 33:39.441
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

33:39.546 --> 33:41.138
- Yes, of course. Sorry.
- Good.

33:53.994 --> 33:55.359
<i>Do you hear me? Is this on?</i>

33:56.363 --> 33:57.455
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

33:58.198 --> 34:01.634
<i>today we take not another step
towards annihilation,</i>

34:02.068 --> 34:03.262
<i>but the first step</i>

34:03.637 --> 34:05.662
<i>on the path to peace.</i>

34:08.008 --> 34:11.068
<i>We begin with a series
of microinjections into</i>

34:11.178 --> 34:14.944
<i>the subject's major muscle groups.
The serum infusion</i>

34:15.315 --> 34:18.113
<i>will cause immediate cellular change.</i>

34:18.685 --> 34:21.654
<i>And then, to stimulate growth,</i>

34:21.855 --> 34:25.256
<i>the subject will be
saturated with Vita-Rays.</i>

34:32.999 --> 34:34.091
That wasn't so bad.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.065
That was penicillin.

34:39.706 --> 34:41.901
Serum infusion beginning in

34:42.309 --> 34:43.298
five,

34:44.377 --> 34:45.366
<i>four,</i>

34:46.813 --> 34:47.802
three,

34:49.249 --> 34:50.739
two,

34:52.185 --> 34:53.174
one.

35:03.763 --> 35:05.094
Now, Mr. Stark.

35:28.522 --> 35:31.491
Steven? Can you hear me?

35:31.925 --> 35:35.053
It's probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

35:36.496 --> 35:38.191
We will proceed.

35:50.744 --> 35:51.733
That's 10%.

35:52.913 --> 35:53.902
Twenty percent.

35:54.314 --> 35:55.440
Thirty.

35:58.084 --> 35:59.142
<i>That's 40%.</i>

36:00.654 --> 36:01.643
Vital signs are normal.

36:01.888 --> 36:02.877
That's 50%.

36:03.690 --> 36:04.679
Sixty.

36:06.393 --> 36:07.655
Seventy.

36:12.265 --> 36:13.254
Steven!

36:13.900 --> 36:15.800
- Steven!
- Shut it down!

36:17.137 --> 36:18.161
Shut it down!

36:18.872 --> 36:19.998
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

36:20.240 --> 36:21.798
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

36:21.908 --> 36:23.205
No!

36:23.643 --> 36:26.203
Don't! I can do this!

36:33.153 --> 36:34.177
Eighty.

36:34.888 --> 36:35.877
Ninety.

36:37.324 --> 36:39.258
That's 100%.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.780
Mr. Stark?

37:13.660 --> 37:15.560
Steven. Steven.

37:18.331 --> 37:19.628
The son of a bitch did it.

37:26.106 --> 37:27.437
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:28.208 --> 37:29.266
I think we did it.

37:29.409 --> 37:30.569
You actually did it.

37:34.547 --> 37:36.139
How do you feel?

37:39.052 --> 37:40.576
Taller.

37:43.590 --> 37:44.921
You look taller.

37:45.191 --> 37:46.818
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

37:47.260 --> 37:51.128
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

37:53.667 --> 37:55.794
Congratulations, Doctor.

37:55.902 --> 37:57.563
Thank you, sir.

38:08.815 --> 38:10.282
Stop him!

39:14.180 --> 39:16.910
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?

39:17.016 --> 39:18.643
Hey, this guy's been shot!

39:29.896 --> 39:30.885
I had him!

39:31.564 --> 39:33.191
Sorry!

39:53.052 --> 39:54.417
I'm sorry!

41:06.926 --> 41:09.554
No! No! Not my son!

41:10.496 --> 41:11.963
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!

41:13.967 --> 41:15.229
Get back!

41:16.369 --> 41:17.734
Let me go!

41:20.807 --> 41:22.172
Let go of my son!

41:24.878 --> 41:26.140
Don't hurt him!

41:30.550 --> 41:32.211
Wait, don't! Don't!

41:33.987 --> 41:35.011
No! Don't!

41:41.094 --> 41:43.062
Go get him! I can swim!

42:35.381 --> 42:37.576
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.

42:37.951 --> 42:39.680
Cut off one head,

42:41.688 --> 42:43.553
two more shall take its place.

42:45.992 --> 42:47.857
Hail Hydra.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.708
<i>The Führer is not accustomed
to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.</i>

43:09.816 --> 43:12.717
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

43:12.819 --> 43:14.719
You serve at his pleasure.

43:14.821 --> 43:17.688
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

43:17.790 --> 43:20.281
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

43:20.426 --> 43:23.054
I no longer reflect his image
of Aryan perfection.

43:23.162 --> 43:25.562
You think this is about appearances?

43:25.665 --> 43:30.068
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver
so much as a rifle in over a year.

43:30.169 --> 43:32.569
And we had learned
through local intelligence

43:32.672 --> 43:35.732
you had mounted a full-scale incursion
into Norway.

43:35.842 --> 43:37.742
<i>The Führer feels... How does he put it?</i>

43:37.844 --> 43:41.075
"The Red Skull has been indulged
long enough!"

43:53.126 --> 43:54.593
Gentlemen,

43:57.196 --> 44:00.654
you have come to see
the results of our work.

44:01.968 --> 44:03.265
Let me show you.

44:04.971 --> 44:07.599
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

44:07.707 --> 44:09.607
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

44:09.709 --> 44:13.042
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

44:13.146 --> 44:17.173
but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.

44:17.650 --> 44:20.813
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

44:21.554 --> 44:25.354
Science. But I understand
your confusion.

44:25.825 --> 44:28.623
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

44:28.895 --> 44:32.991
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

44:33.232 --> 44:36.531
wherever they are, regardless of
how many forces they possess,

44:36.636 --> 44:37.728
all in a matter of hours.

44:38.071 --> 44:39.368
Your enemies?

44:39.472 --> 44:42.100
My weapons contain
enough destructive power

44:42.208 --> 44:44.836
to decimate
every hostile capital on Earth.

44:47.346 --> 44:48.973
Quite simply, gentlemen,

44:49.916 --> 44:52.407
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

44:54.454 --> 44:55.512
Thank you, Schmidt.

44:55.621 --> 44:56.588
For what?

44:57.056 --> 45:00.287
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

45:00.393 --> 45:01.792
Berlin is on this map!

45:02.728 --> 45:04.252
So it is.

45:06.365 --> 45:08.959
You will be punished for your insolence!

45:09.068 --> 45:11.593
<i>You will be brought
before the Führer himself!</i>

45:20.813 --> 45:22.781
Schmidt...

45:27.753 --> 45:29.687
My apologies, Doctor,

45:29.789 --> 45:34.749
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

45:36.129 --> 45:37.153
Hail Hydra.

45:37.964 --> 45:39.659
Hail Hydra!

45:44.270 --> 45:45.999
Hail Hydra!

45:57.650 --> 45:59.242
Think you got enough?

46:00.786 --> 46:04.916
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

46:05.558 --> 46:08.186
But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.

46:09.529 --> 46:11.224
He deserved more than this.

46:12.632 --> 46:16.090
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

46:19.005 --> 46:21.906
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

46:22.308 --> 46:23.832
Great. Why don't we start with how

46:23.943 --> 46:27.106
a German spy got a ride to
my secret installation in your car?

46:27.213 --> 46:28.703
What have we got here?

46:28.814 --> 46:31.840
Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

46:32.185 --> 46:34.847
But I don't know what's inside this thing
or how it works.

46:35.321 --> 46:36.788
We're not even close to this technology.

46:36.889 --> 46:38.516
- Then who is?
- Hydra.

46:39.158 --> 46:40.523
I'm sure you've been
reading our briefings.

46:41.060 --> 46:43.051
I'm on a number of
committees, Colonel.

46:43.162 --> 46:45.357
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.

46:45.464 --> 46:49.059
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

46:49.168 --> 46:50.362
Hydra is practically a cult.

46:50.469 --> 46:52.061
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

46:52.572 --> 46:53.732
So, what are you going to do about it?

46:54.807 --> 46:56.035
I spoke to the President this morning.

46:56.542 --> 46:59.568
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?

46:59.679 --> 47:02.978
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

47:03.082 --> 47:04.379
You, too, Stark.

47:04.784 --> 47:06.411
We're flying to London tonight.

47:06.519 --> 47:08.817
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.

47:09.121 --> 47:11.089
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

47:11.691 --> 47:12.749
The serum worked.

47:12.858 --> 47:14.655
I asked for an army
and all I got was you.

47:15.261 --> 47:17.855
You are not enough.

47:22.034 --> 47:23.331
With all due respect to the Colonel,

47:24.003 --> 47:25.800
I think we may be missing the point.

47:26.172 --> 47:30.472
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.

47:30.843 --> 47:31.810
Paper.

47:32.778 --> 47:34.473
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

47:34.580 --> 47:36.411
since your picture hit the newsstands.

47:37.283 --> 47:40.377
You don't take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

47:40.720 --> 47:42.415
and hide him in a lab.

47:42.989 --> 47:46.891
Son, do you want to serve your country

47:46.993 --> 47:49.962
on the most important battlefield
of the war?

47:51.264 --> 47:53.255
Sir, that's all I want.

47:53.866 --> 47:57.267
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

48:00.406 --> 48:01.600
I don't know if I can do this.

48:01.707 --> 48:06.337
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

48:06.746 --> 48:08.270
You're an American hero.

48:08.514 --> 48:10.675
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

48:11.317 --> 48:13.376
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

48:13.486 --> 48:14.612
You play ball with us,

48:14.720 --> 48:16.654
you'll be leading your own platoon
in no time.

48:16.756 --> 48:18.246
Take the shield.

48:19.592 --> 48:20.650
Go.

48:22.028 --> 48:26.658
<i>Who's strong and brave
Here to save the American way?</i>

48:27.933 --> 48:30.663
Not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank.

48:30.770 --> 48:32.465
But there's still a way all of us can fight.

48:32.571 --> 48:37.235
<i>Who vows to fight like a man
For what's right, night and day?</i>

48:37.643 --> 48:39.235
Series E Defense Bonds.

48:39.345 --> 48:43.042
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

48:43.182 --> 48:46.640
<i>Who will campaign door-to-door
for America?</i>

48:46.752 --> 48:50.017
<i>Carry the flag shore to shore
for America?</i>

48:50.122 --> 48:53.182
<i>From Hoboken to Spokane</i>

48:53.292 --> 48:59.288
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

49:01.667 --> 49:04.397
Cut. Guys, don't look at the camera.

49:04.537 --> 49:08.530
<i>We can't ignore there's a threat
and a war we must win</i>

49:08.641 --> 49:11.439
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

49:11.544 --> 49:17.005
<i>Who'll hang a noose on the
goose-stepping goons from Berlin?</i>

49:18.484 --> 49:21.783
<i>Who will redeem
Heed the call for America?</i>

49:22.021 --> 49:25.081
<i>Who'll rise or fall
Give his all for America?</i>

49:25.658 --> 49:28.491
<i>Who's here to prove that we can?</i>

49:28.594 --> 49:34.658
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

49:35.134 --> 49:37.432
We all know this is about
trying to win the war.

49:37.536 --> 49:40.699
We can't do that without bullets
and bandages, tanks and tents.

49:40.806 --> 49:43.001
That's where you come in.
Every bond you buy

49:43.109 --> 49:44.337
will help protect someone you love.

49:44.910 --> 49:47.310
- Turn around! He's right behind you!
- Keep our boys armed and ready,

49:47.413 --> 49:50.143
and the Germans will think twice about
trying to get the drop on us.

49:54.053 --> 49:59.753
<i>Stalwart and steady and true</i>

50:01.227 --> 50:04.196
<i>Forceful and ready to defend</i>

50:04.330 --> 50:08.096
<i>the red, white, and blue</i>

50:08.200 --> 50:11.537
<i>Who'll give the Axis the sack
and is smart as a fox?</i>

50:11.537 --> 50:12.094
<i>Who'll give the Axis the sack
and is smart as a fox?</i>

50:12.204 --> 50:15.469
<i>Far as an eagle will soar</i>

50:15.574 --> 50:19.203
<i>Who's making Adolf
afraid to step out of his box?</i>

50:19.311 --> 50:22.246
<i>He knows what we're fighting for</i>

50:22.415 --> 50:25.782
<i>Who waked the giant
that napped in America?</i>

50:25.885 --> 50:29.321
<i>We know it's no one
but Captain America</i>

50:30.055 --> 50:31.022
Hi.

50:31.123 --> 50:32.920
<i>Who'll finish what they began?</i>

50:33.025 --> 50:39.897
<i>Who'll kick the Krauts to Japan?
The star-spangled man</i>

50:39.999 --> 50:42.763
<i>with a</i>

50:43.536 --> 50:46.334
<i>plan!</i>

50:54.313 --> 50:58.181
<i>How many of you are ready to
help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?</i>

51:02.888 --> 51:04.014
<i>Okay.</i>

51:07.593 --> 51:08.992
<i>I need a volunteer.</i>

51:09.094 --> 51:11.289
I already volunteered!
How do you think I got here?

51:12.798 --> 51:14.823
Bring back the girls!

51:18.871 --> 51:21.169
<i>I think they only know the one song, but</i>

51:21.907 --> 51:23.374
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

51:23.709 --> 51:25.370
You do that, sweetheart.

51:25.878 --> 51:28.506
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

51:29.582 --> 51:31.948
<i>Come on, guys,
we're all on the same team here.</i>

51:32.151 --> 51:34.312
Hey, Captain! Sign this!

51:45.164 --> 51:47.029
Bring back the girls!

51:51.670 --> 51:54.298
Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.

52:02.681 --> 52:04.046
Hello, Steve.

52:05.417 --> 52:06.543
Hi.

52:07.620 --> 52:09.815
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

52:09.922 --> 52:12.117
Officially, I'm not here at all.

52:12.591 --> 52:14.491
That was quite a performance.

52:14.894 --> 52:15.861
Yeah.

52:17.096 --> 52:18.723
I had to improvise a little bit.

52:19.098 --> 52:21.566
The crowds I'm used to
are usually more

52:23.168 --> 52:24.135
twelve.

52:24.236 --> 52:26.170
I understand you're
"America's New Hope."

52:26.272 --> 52:28.832
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

52:28.941 --> 52:30.465
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

52:32.111 --> 52:34.170
At least he's got me doing this.

52:34.280 --> 52:35.804
Phillips would have had me
stuck in a lab.

52:36.115 --> 52:38.583
And these are your only two options?

52:38.951 --> 52:41.249
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

52:41.954 --> 52:44.582
You were meant for more than this,
you know.

52:50.462 --> 52:51.486
What?

52:52.865 --> 52:55.698
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about

52:56.302 --> 52:59.601
coming overseas
and being on the front lines,

52:59.972 --> 53:01.439
serving my country.

53:02.308 --> 53:04.276
I finally got everything I wanted

53:07.813 --> 53:08.837
and I'm wearing tights.

53:17.489 --> 53:18.956
They look like they've been through hell.

53:19.792 --> 53:20.986
These men more than most.

53:24.830 --> 53:29.790
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him,

53:30.669 --> 53:32.796
and less than 50 returned.

53:33.706 --> 53:36.106
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

53:37.009 --> 53:38.874
The rest were killed or captured.

53:39.078 --> 53:40.670
The 107th?

53:40.779 --> 53:41.746
What?

53:42.214 --> 53:43.545
Come on.

53:44.650 --> 53:45.617
Colonel Phillips.

53:45.718 --> 53:47.549
Well, if it isn't
the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

53:47.653 --> 53:48.915
What's your plan today?

53:49.088 --> 53:50.248
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

53:50.356 --> 53:51.653
You don't get to give me orders, son.

53:51.757 --> 53:54.885
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

53:55.494 --> 53:57.985
You and I are gonna have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

53:58.097 --> 54:01.191
- Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
- I can spell.

54:07.239 --> 54:11.699
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

54:12.044 --> 54:14.103
But the name does sound familiar.

54:14.713 --> 54:15.737
I'm sorry.

54:19.952 --> 54:22.386
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

54:22.721 --> 54:24.018
Yes, it's called "winning the war."

54:25.557 --> 54:27.047
But if you know where they are,
why not at least...

54:27.159 --> 54:28.888
They're 30 miles behind the lines

54:29.028 --> 54:31.792
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

54:31.897 --> 54:33.364
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

54:33.465 --> 54:36.127
But I don't expect you to understand that
because you're a chorus girl.

54:38.404 --> 54:39.803
I think I understand just fine.

54:40.339 --> 54:41.966
Well, then understand it
somewhere else.

54:42.307 --> 54:46.505
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

54:51.383 --> 54:54.011
Yes, sir. I do.

54:58.123 --> 55:03.117
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

55:06.365 --> 55:08.230
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

55:08.367 --> 55:09.732
If that's what it takes.

55:09.835 --> 55:11.928
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

55:12.037 --> 55:13.004
You don't know that.

55:13.105 --> 55:15.073
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...

55:15.174 --> 55:17.972
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

55:18.077 --> 55:19.101
Steve!

55:25.584 --> 55:29.680
You told me you thought I was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?

55:31.390 --> 55:32.687
Every word.

55:34.426 --> 55:35.415
Then you got to let me go.

55:39.031 --> 55:40.828
I can do more than that.

55:41.233 --> 55:44.202
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

55:45.704 --> 55:46.966
Where's my helmet?

55:47.072 --> 55:48.471
Anyone seen Rogers?

55:52.411 --> 55:54.379
<i>The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,</i>

55:54.480 --> 55:56.471
tucked between
these two mountain ranges.

55:56.582 --> 55:57.640
It's a factory of some kind.

55:57.750 --> 55:59.980
We should be able to
drop you right on the doorstep.

56:00.085 --> 56:01.780
Just get me as close as you can.

56:01.887 --> 56:03.548
You two are gonna be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

56:03.655 --> 56:04.622
And you won't?

56:04.723 --> 56:07.191
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.

56:07.292 --> 56:08.919
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

56:09.027 --> 56:10.995
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

56:11.096 --> 56:12.120
Agent Carter?

56:12.231 --> 56:13.528
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

56:13.632 --> 56:17.159
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.

56:22.441 --> 56:25.239
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.

56:25.511 --> 56:27.979
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

56:29.748 --> 56:31.511
So, are you two... Do you...

56:33.952 --> 56:35.078
...fondue?

56:36.288 --> 56:38.449
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready

56:38.590 --> 56:40.990
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

56:42.094 --> 56:43.959
Are you sure this thing works?

56:44.062 --> 56:46.326
It's been tested more than you, pal.

56:51.470 --> 56:53.995
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!

56:55.808 --> 56:58.777
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here!

56:59.044 --> 57:01.012
You can't give me orders!

57:01.313 --> 57:03.941
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!

57:22.167 --> 57:26.604
<i>As you can see, production of
the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,</i>

57:26.705 --> 57:29.003
even with components of this size.

57:29.341 --> 57:32.037
Increase the output by 60%

57:32.344 --> 57:35.973
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

57:36.515 --> 57:40.815
But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.

57:41.186 --> 57:44.155
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

57:44.690 --> 57:47.488
There are always more workers.

57:49.528 --> 57:50.654
Not now!

58:06.044 --> 58:07.841
You know, Fritz,

58:08.881 --> 58:11.179
one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

58:44.316 --> 58:45.442
Fellas.

1:00:47.039 --> 1:00:48.336
Who are you supposed to be?

1:00:48.707 --> 1:00:51.972
I'm Captain America.

1:00:53.245 --> 1:00:54.678
I beg your pardon?

1:00:58.116 --> 1:00:59.913
What, are we taking everybody?

1:01:00.285 --> 1:01:01.843
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

1:01:02.054 --> 1:01:04.784
Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

1:01:05.123 --> 1:01:08.092
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

1:01:08.193 --> 1:01:09.285
All right.

1:01:09.394 --> 1:01:11.419
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

1:01:11.530 --> 1:01:13.725
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

1:01:13.832 --> 1:01:15.527
I'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

1:01:15.634 --> 1:01:18.159
Wait. You know what you're doing?

1:01:18.270 --> 1:01:21.103
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler
over 200 times.

1:01:46.131 --> 1:01:47.860
You know how to use that thing?

1:01:51.870 --> 1:01:52.837
Okay.

1:01:55.173 --> 1:01:56.640
What is happening?

1:02:04.950 --> 1:02:06.918
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

1:02:08.420 --> 1:02:10.354
<i>- That one. "Zündung."
- Zündung?</i>

1:02:11.289 --> 1:02:12.256
Get this thing going, Dugan!

1:02:12.357 --> 1:02:13.688
I didn't know you spoke German.

1:02:13.792 --> 1:02:16.989
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

1:02:17.095 --> 1:02:18.062
Didn't ask for the resume.

1:02:30.842 --> 1:02:32.207
- On your left!
- Up top!

1:02:49.828 --> 1:02:52.126
No, no! What are you doing?

1:02:53.231 --> 1:02:56.200
Our forces are outmatched.

1:03:20.859 --> 1:03:23.555
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

1:04:03.168 --> 1:04:06.160
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

1:04:07.272 --> 1:04:08.239
Bucky?

1:04:09.374 --> 1:04:10.341
Oh, my God.

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:16.947
- Is that...
- It's me.

1:04:17.182 --> 1:04:19.013
- It's Steve.
- Steve?

1:04:19.117 --> 1:04:20.550
- Come on.
- Steve.

1:04:24.723 --> 1:04:25.849
I thought you were dead.

1:04:26.791 --> 1:04:28.156
I thought you were smaller.

1:04:36.067 --> 1:04:37.125
Come on.

1:04:39.571 --> 1:04:42.369
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.

1:04:48.747 --> 1:04:50.806
- Did it hurt?
- A little.

1:04:51.249 --> 1:04:52.546
Is this permanent?

1:04:52.751 --> 1:04:53.809
So far.

1:05:23.848 --> 1:05:25.475
Captain America!

1:05:25.703 --> 1:05:27.330
How exciting!

1:05:27.872 --> 1:05:30.841
I am a great fan of your films!

1:05:32.543 --> 1:05:36.502
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

1:05:36.881 --> 1:05:38.678
Not exactly an improvement,

1:05:38.783 --> 1:05:42.082
but still, impressive.

1:05:44.889 --> 1:05:46.356
You've got no idea.

1:05:49.460 --> 1:05:50.518
Haven't I?

1:06:06.210 --> 1:06:09.202
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:12.677
you see, I was his greatest success!

1:06:26.164 --> 1:06:27.961
You don't have one of those, do you?

1:06:28.266 --> 1:06:30.564
You are deluded, Captain.

1:06:31.269 --> 1:06:33.897
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

1:06:34.005 --> 1:06:36.405
but in reality, you are just afraid

1:06:36.507 --> 1:06:40.136
to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

1:06:41.946 --> 1:06:44.642
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

1:06:45.850 --> 1:06:46.908
Without fear!

1:06:47.185 --> 1:06:48.482
Then how come you're running?

1:07:00.598 --> 1:07:02.623
Come on, let's go. Up.

1:07:05.603 --> 1:07:07.935
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

1:07:11.476 --> 1:07:12.773
What about me?

1:07:13.010 --> 1:07:14.807
Where will I sit?

1:07:15.446 --> 1:07:17.141
Not a scratch, Doctor.

1:07:17.315 --> 1:07:18.782
Not a scratch.

1:07:51.849 --> 1:07:54.010
Let's go. One at a time.

1:08:22.713 --> 1:08:25.682
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!

1:08:25.783 --> 1:08:27.148
No! Not without you!

1:08:28.085 --> 1:08:29.382
Hell.

1:08:50.575 --> 1:08:53.908
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that

1:08:54.011 --> 1:08:58.812
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.

1:08:58.916 --> 1:09:01.043
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

1:09:01.152 --> 1:09:05.111
As a result,
I must declare Captain Rogers

1:09:05.990 --> 1:09:08.117
killed in action. Period.

1:09:12.163 --> 1:09:13.892
The last surveillance flight is back.

1:09:16.334 --> 1:09:18.302
No sign of activity.

1:09:19.103 --> 1:09:21.867
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

1:09:24.509 --> 1:09:25.635
I can't touch Stark.

1:09:25.776 --> 1:09:28.574
He's rich and he's the Army's
number one weapons contractor.

1:09:28.679 --> 1:09:30.169
You are neither one.

1:09:30.281 --> 1:09:32.749
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

1:09:32.850 --> 1:09:34.511
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.

1:09:34.619 --> 1:09:37.417
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

1:09:37.522 --> 1:09:39.319
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

1:09:39.423 --> 1:09:42.984
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

1:09:43.094 --> 1:09:44.061
'cause you had a crush.

1:09:44.161 --> 1:09:46.493
It wasn't that. I had faith.

1:09:47.031 --> 1:09:51.593
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

1:09:54.138 --> 1:09:55.435
What the hell's going on out there?

1:10:38.382 --> 1:10:40.145
Look who it is!

1:11:07.311 --> 1:11:09.438
Some of these men
need medical attention.

1:11:09.547 --> 1:11:11.447
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.

1:11:11.549 --> 1:11:14.109
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

1:11:15.553 --> 1:11:17.180
That won't be necessary.

1:11:21.058 --> 1:11:22.286
Yes, sir.

1:11:23.861 --> 1:11:25.328
Faith, huh?

1:11:32.069 --> 1:11:33.331
You're late.

1:11:37.208 --> 1:11:38.869
Couldn't call my ride.

1:11:41.178 --> 1:11:42.611
Hey!

1:11:42.913 --> 1:11:44.540
Let's hear it for Captain America!

1:12:01.565 --> 1:12:04.864
<i>I am honored
to present this medal for valor</i>

1:12:05.002 --> 1:12:08.597
to my personal friend, Captain America!

1:12:11.242 --> 1:12:12.869
Captain America!

1:12:14.478 --> 1:12:16.446
Captain, that's your cue!

1:12:20.251 --> 1:12:22.276
I thought he'd be taller.

1:12:34.298 --> 1:12:37.358
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

1:12:37.468 --> 1:12:39.595
And the sixth one was

1:12:40.137 --> 1:12:45.097
about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.

1:12:46.911 --> 1:12:48.776
I just got a quick look.

1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:51.448
Well, nobody's perfect.

1:12:54.752 --> 1:12:57.118
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

1:12:57.588 --> 1:12:59.419
Sergeant Barnes said
that Hydra shipped

1:12:59.523 --> 1:13:02.048
all the parts to another facility
that isn't on this map.

1:13:02.159 --> 1:13:03.786
Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.

1:13:03.894 --> 1:13:06.556
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

1:13:06.664 --> 1:13:07.688
What about us?

1:13:07.798 --> 1:13:10.562
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

1:13:10.668 --> 1:13:12.636
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.

1:13:12.737 --> 1:13:16.332
- You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
- Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

1:13:16.774 --> 1:13:18.799
We're already putting together
the best men.

1:13:19.176 --> 1:13:21.974
With all due respect, sir, so am I.

1:13:23.347 --> 1:13:24.712
So, let's get this straight.

1:13:24.815 --> 1:13:26.806
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

1:13:28.552 --> 1:13:29.780
Pretty much.

1:13:29.887 --> 1:13:32.185
Sounds rather fun, actually.

1:13:33.891 --> 1:13:34.858
I'm in.

1:13:47.538 --> 1:13:48.835
We're in.

1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:53.037
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

1:13:53.144 --> 1:13:54.133
What's that?

1:13:56.313 --> 1:13:57.337
Open a tab.

1:14:01.218 --> 1:14:02.685
Well, that was easy.

1:14:03.053 --> 1:14:05.487
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?

1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:11.687
See? I told you.

1:14:12.329 --> 1:14:14.297
They're all idiots.

1:14:14.899 --> 1:14:16.196
How about you?

1:14:17.001 --> 1:14:20.027
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

1:14:20.337 --> 1:14:21.463
Hell, no.

1:14:21.572 --> 1:14:26.032
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

1:14:27.244 --> 1:14:28.871
I'm following him.

1:14:32.416 --> 1:14:33.781
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

1:14:36.754 --> 1:14:37.880
You know what?

1:14:39.056 --> 1:14:40.182
It's kind of growing on me.

1:14:51.669 --> 1:14:53.068
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

1:14:55.806 --> 1:14:56.773
Ma'am.

1:14:56.874 --> 1:14:59.843
Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?

1:14:59.944 --> 1:15:01.241
Sounds good.

1:15:05.950 --> 1:15:08.646
I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

1:15:09.119 --> 1:15:10.086
You don't like music?

1:15:10.187 --> 1:15:11.552
I do, actually.

1:15:13.357 --> 1:15:16.815
I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

1:15:17.194 --> 1:15:18.491
Then what are we waiting for?

1:15:19.463 --> 1:15:20.987
The right partner.

1:15:22.132 --> 1:15:23.429
0800, Captain.

1:15:24.635 --> 1:15:26.933
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

1:15:27.304 --> 1:15:28.828
I'm invisible.

1:15:29.373 --> 1:15:32.433
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

1:15:33.043 --> 1:15:36.103
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

1:15:37.815 --> 1:15:40.443
Emission signature is unusual.

1:15:40.985 --> 1:15:42.953
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

1:15:44.388 --> 1:15:46.788
Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.

1:15:48.492 --> 1:15:49.789
Seems harmless enough.

1:15:51.161 --> 1:15:53.026
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

1:16:02.573 --> 1:16:03.870
Write that down.

1:16:05.843 --> 1:16:08.539
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

1:16:08.646 --> 1:16:10.705
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

1:16:15.519 --> 1:16:18.317
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

1:16:25.729 --> 1:16:27.060
I read about what you did.

1:16:27.431 --> 1:16:29.058
Oh, the... Yeah.

1:16:29.867 --> 1:16:31.391
Well, that's, you know.

1:16:33.037 --> 1:16:34.436
Just doing what needed to be done.

1:16:34.772 --> 1:16:37.605
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

1:16:43.948 --> 1:16:45.916
Really, it's not a big deal.

1:16:46.817 --> 1:16:48.944
Tell that to their wives.

1:16:52.323 --> 1:16:53.915
I don't think they were all married.

1:16:54.124 --> 1:16:55.682
You're a hero.

1:16:55.793 --> 1:16:58.284
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

1:16:58.395 --> 1:17:01.694
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:05.835
And seeing as they're not here...

1:17:14.511 --> 1:17:15.500
Captain!

1:17:15.612 --> 1:17:18.240
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

1:17:19.383 --> 1:17:20.850
Agent Carter, wait.

1:17:21.151 --> 1:17:23.278
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

1:17:23.387 --> 1:17:24.979
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

1:17:25.089 --> 1:17:27.683
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

1:17:27.992 --> 1:17:31.621
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

1:17:31.895 --> 1:17:32.987
Well, what about you and Stark?

1:17:33.097 --> 1:17:35.565
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

1:17:40.504 --> 1:17:42.802
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

1:17:44.408 --> 1:17:46.399
<i>Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.</i>

1:17:46.510 --> 1:17:49.308
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

1:17:49.413 --> 1:17:51.404
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

1:17:51.515 --> 1:17:53.881
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

1:17:53.984 --> 1:17:56.646
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

1:17:56.754 --> 1:17:59.587
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

1:17:59.857 --> 1:18:01.552
Carbon polymer.

1:18:02.226 --> 1:18:04.592
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

1:18:04.695 --> 1:18:08.153
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

1:18:08.532 --> 1:18:11.262
I hear you're kind of attached.

1:18:11.368 --> 1:18:12.767
It's handier than you might think.

1:18:12.870 --> 1:18:14.997
I took the liberty
of coming up with some options.

1:18:15.706 --> 1:18:16.730
This one's fun.

1:18:17.574 --> 1:18:20.099
She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...

1:18:20.210 --> 1:18:21.768
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

1:18:21.879 --> 1:18:24.006
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.

1:18:25.115 --> 1:18:27.743
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

1:18:28.385 --> 1:18:31.183
It's completely vibration absorbent.

1:18:33.190 --> 1:18:34.748
How come it's not standard issue?

1:18:34.858 --> 1:18:36.189
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

1:18:36.293 --> 1:18:37.954
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

1:18:38.062 --> 1:18:40.257
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

1:18:40.364 --> 1:18:42.195
I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

1:18:42.299 --> 1:18:44.199
What do you think?

1:18:54.078 --> 1:18:56.046
Yes, I think it works.

1:19:05.355 --> 1:19:07.482
I had some ideas about the uniform.

1:19:07.758 --> 1:19:09.248
Whatever you want, pal.

1:21:13.951 --> 1:21:16.283
You are failing!

1:21:17.187 --> 1:21:20.452
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

1:21:20.557 --> 1:21:22.491
yet we are continually delayed

1:21:22.593 --> 1:21:25.255
because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

1:21:25.362 --> 1:21:27.330
This is hardly my area of expertise.

1:21:27.431 --> 1:21:31.128
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

1:21:32.436 --> 1:21:35.701
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

1:21:36.473 --> 1:21:37.462
Sir!

1:21:39.776 --> 1:21:40.800
<i>I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.</i>

1:21:42.379 --> 1:21:44.176
We fought to the last man.

1:21:47.484 --> 1:21:49.452
Evidently not.

1:22:01.665 --> 1:22:04.862
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

1:22:04.968 --> 1:22:06.595
Yeah, and I threw up?

1:22:07.938 --> 1:22:09.405
This isn't payback, is it?

1:22:09.506 --> 1:22:11.235
Now why would I do that?

1:22:11.341 --> 1:22:14.071
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

1:22:14.177 --> 1:22:17.704
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

1:22:17.814 --> 1:22:19.714
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

1:22:26.823 --> 1:22:29.189
Let's get going,
because they're moving like the devil.

1:22:29.826 --> 1:22:31.521
We only got about a 10-second window.

1:22:31.628 --> 1:22:34.188
You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.

1:22:34.831 --> 1:22:35.798
Mind the gap.

1:22:35.899 --> 1:22:37.764
Better get moving, bugs!

1:23:45.602 --> 1:23:47.695
Stop him! Fire again!

1:24:40.323 --> 1:24:42.883
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:44.584
Get down!

1:24:46.830 --> 1:24:48.161
Fire again!

1:24:48.932 --> 1:24:50.456
<i>Kill him! Now!</i>

1:24:57.741 --> 1:24:58.708
Bucky!

1:25:02.813 --> 1:25:04.246
Hang on!

1:25:05.982 --> 1:25:06.949
Grab my hand!

1:26:12.549 --> 1:26:13.846
Sit down.

1:26:20.323 --> 1:26:22.621
- What is this?
- Steak.

1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:24.686
What is in it?

1:26:25.829 --> 1:26:27.126
Cow.

1:26:30.233 --> 1:26:33.225
Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is

1:26:33.336 --> 1:26:36.134
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

1:26:37.574 --> 1:26:38.973
I don't eat meat.

1:26:39.910 --> 1:26:41.036
Why not?

1:26:41.144 --> 1:26:42.805
It disagrees with me.

1:26:42.913 --> 1:26:45.814
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

1:26:48.752 --> 1:26:51.915
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

1:26:52.022 --> 1:26:56.823
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

1:26:57.861 --> 1:27:00.659
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1:27:02.933 --> 1:27:04.230
You want to live.

1:27:05.602 --> 1:27:07.729
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1:27:08.371 --> 1:27:09.963
I bought you dinner.

1:27:15.211 --> 1:27:18.271
"Given the valuable information
he has provided

1:27:19.049 --> 1:27:22.610
"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

1:27:23.053 --> 1:27:25.920
"Dr. Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland"?

1:27:26.022 --> 1:27:29.981
I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

1:27:30.694 --> 1:27:34.289
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

1:27:34.397 --> 1:27:36.365
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1:27:36.466 --> 1:27:40.027
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

1:27:40.470 --> 1:27:42.438
You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.

1:27:42.806 --> 1:27:47.937
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1:27:48.044 --> 1:27:50.979
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

1:27:51.748 --> 1:27:54.376
It's you or Schmidt.

1:27:54.985 --> 1:27:57.044
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1:27:59.656 --> 1:28:02.750
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1:28:04.494 --> 1:28:07.292
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1:28:07.397 --> 1:28:09.592
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

1:28:09.699 --> 1:28:10.666
What?

1:28:11.701 --> 1:28:13.896
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1:28:14.004 --> 1:28:16.131
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:18.137
What's his target?

1:28:19.442 --> 1:28:21.774
His target

1:28:23.346 --> 1:28:24.404
is everywhere.

1:28:45.235 --> 1:28:46.862
Tomorrow,

1:28:47.637 --> 1:28:50.936
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1:28:51.708 --> 1:28:54.176
<i>borne to victory on the wings
of the Valkyrie.</i>

1:28:55.345 --> 1:28:59.247
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1:28:59.883 --> 1:29:04.843
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1:29:09.359 --> 1:29:11.725
If they cut off one head,

1:29:12.262 --> 1:29:15.026
two more shall take its place.

1:29:15.398 --> 1:29:16.695
Hail Hydra.

1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:17.967
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra!

1:29:18.668 --> 1:29:21.296
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1:29:33.283 --> 1:29:36.081
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1:29:36.453 --> 1:29:38.421
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

1:29:38.788 --> 1:29:43.748
<i>Your attention, please. All citizens shall
remain indoors until further notice.</i>

1:29:44.461 --> 1:29:47.521
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1:29:55.538 --> 1:29:57.506
Dr. Erskine said that

1:29:57.874 --> 1:30:00.342
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

1:30:00.443 --> 1:30:02.502
it would affect my cells.

1:30:03.546 --> 1:30:07.346
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1:30:07.450 --> 1:30:09.077
Which means

1:30:11.387 --> 1:30:13.014
I can't get drunk.

1:30:14.824 --> 1:30:16.121
Did you know that?

1:30:16.559 --> 1:30:20.791
Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

1:30:22.532 --> 1:30:25.160
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

1:30:30.173 --> 1:30:32.141
It wasn't your fault.

1:30:33.309 --> 1:30:34.936
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.

1:30:36.146 --> 1:30:37.443
Then you know that's not true.

1:30:37.547 --> 1:30:39.276
You did everything you could.

1:30:42.685 --> 1:30:44.812
Did you believe in your friend?

1:30:44.921 --> 1:30:46.388
Did you respect him?

1:30:48.024 --> 1:30:49.924
Then stop blaming yourself.

1:30:50.293 --> 1:30:52.625
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1:30:53.029 --> 1:30:54.519
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

1:30:57.133 --> 1:30:58.657
I'm going after Schmidt.

1:31:00.303 --> 1:31:03.602
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra
is dead or captured.

1:31:05.542 --> 1:31:07.169
You won't be alone.

1:31:09.813 --> 1:31:12.976
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1:31:13.082 --> 1:31:15.016
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it,

1:31:15.118 --> 1:31:16.676
starting with the USA.

1:31:16.786 --> 1:31:19.880
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1:31:19.989 --> 1:31:21.718
He gets across the Atlantic,

1:31:21.825 --> 1:31:24.225
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1:31:28.698 --> 1:31:30.290
How much time we got?

1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:32.664
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1:31:32.769 --> 1:31:35.738
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.

1:31:36.606 --> 1:31:40.007
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1:31:42.045 --> 1:31:43.444
So what are we supposed to do?

1:31:43.546 --> 1:31:46.106
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1:31:46.783 --> 1:31:48.080
Why not?

1:31:53.189 --> 1:31:55.350
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1:34:00.984 --> 1:34:05.080
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1:34:05.188 --> 1:34:07.281
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1:34:10.226 --> 1:34:12.854
But there are limits

1:34:13.229 --> 1:34:15.493
to what even you can do, Captain.

1:34:15.999 --> 1:34:19.230
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1:34:19.335 --> 1:34:20.768
He told me you were insane.

1:34:25.508 --> 1:34:27.476
He resented my genius

1:34:27.577 --> 1:34:31.138
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

1:34:31.247 --> 1:34:32.805
But he gave you everything.

1:34:35.251 --> 1:34:36.479
So,

1:34:38.287 --> 1:34:40.847
what made you so special?

1:34:44.060 --> 1:34:45.186
Nothing.

1:34:46.396 --> 1:34:47.920
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1:34:59.475 --> 1:35:01.033
I can do this all day.

1:35:01.144 --> 1:35:03.135
Of course you can, of course.

1:35:03.246 --> 1:35:06.545
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

1:35:12.255 --> 1:35:13.620
So am I.

1:35:26.102 --> 1:35:28.730
Rogers! You might need this!

1:35:29.205 --> 1:35:30.172
Thanks!

1:35:41.417 --> 1:35:43.908
We're in! Assault team, go!

1:35:44.153 --> 1:35:45.450
Move out!

1:35:46.389 --> 1:35:48.118
Move!

1:35:54.030 --> 1:35:56.055
Keep your spacing!

1:36:35.671 --> 1:36:37.832
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1:36:39.375 --> 1:36:41.036
Let's go find two more!

1:37:07.770 --> 1:37:08.737
You're late.

1:37:11.774 --> 1:37:13.742
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.

1:38:28.417 --> 1:38:29.406
Get in!

1:38:58.114 --> 1:38:59.411
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!

1:39:04.987 --> 1:39:06.181
Go get him.

1:39:08.157 --> 1:39:09.818
I'm not kissing you!

1:42:49.311 --> 1:42:52.439
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!

1:44:01.317 --> 1:44:03.877
You could have the power of the gods!

1:44:04.587 --> 1:44:09.217
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1:44:10.125 --> 1:44:12.252
I have seen the future, Captain!

1:44:13.228 --> 1:44:16.254
- There are no flags!
- Not my future!

1:44:30.145 --> 1:44:31.169
What have you done?

1:44:32.147 --> 1:44:33.114
No!

1:45:41.417 --> 1:45:43.476
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

1:45:43.752 --> 1:45:44.912
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1:45:45.020 --> 1:45:46.419
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1:45:46.522 --> 1:45:48.012
<i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead!</i>

1:45:48.724 --> 1:45:50.248
<i>What about the plane?</i>

1:45:52.127 --> 1:45:53.594
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1:45:54.063 --> 1:45:56.429
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.

1:45:57.733 --> 1:45:59.826
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1:46:00.102 --> 1:46:01.694
<i>But I can try and force it down.</i>

1:46:01.804 --> 1:46:03.772
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.

1:46:03.872 --> 1:46:04.861
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

1:46:04.973 --> 1:46:07.567
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i>

1:46:12.181 --> 1:46:13.944
I got to put her in the water.

1:46:14.416 --> 1:46:17.112
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1:46:17.419 --> 1:46:18.545
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1:46:18.654 --> 1:46:21.054
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are gonna die.

1:46:26.595 --> 1:46:27.789
Peggy,

1:46:29.598 --> 1:46:30.860
this is my choice.

1:46:55.124 --> 1:46:56.250
Peggy?

1:46:57.126 --> 1:46:58.423
<i>I'm here.</i>

1:47:01.296 --> 1:47:04.094
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

1:47:12.307 --> 1:47:13.433
All right.

1:47:16.478 --> 1:47:18.844
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

1:47:20.315 --> 1:47:21.612
You got it.

1:47:23.552 --> 1:47:27.511
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?</i>

1:47:29.892 --> 1:47:31.951
You know,
I still don't know how to dance.

1:47:38.167 --> 1:47:41.136
I'll show you how. Just be there.

1:47:42.504 --> 1:47:44.131
We'll have the band
play something slow.

1:47:48.243 --> 1:47:49.801
<i>I'd hate to step on your...</i>

1:47:52.848 --> 1:47:53.815
Steve?

1:47:56.351 --> 1:47:57.648
Steve?

1:48:01.023 --> 1:48:02.217
Steve?

1:49:01.283 --> 1:49:02.750
To the Captain.

1:49:14.930 --> 1:49:15.897
Sir?

1:49:26.041 --> 1:49:28.009
Take us to the next grid point.

1:49:28.277 --> 1:49:30.336
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1:49:31.046 --> 1:49:33.674
And the energy signature stops here.

1:49:34.783 --> 1:49:36.512
Just keep looking.

1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:47.645
<i>Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one.</i>

1:50:48.957 --> 1:50:51.653
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

1:50:52.561 --> 1:50:54.927
<i>And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,</i>

1:50:55.030 --> 1:50:57.897
<i>this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.</i>

1:50:59.368 --> 1:51:02.496
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.</i>

1:51:03.372 --> 1:51:06.535
<i>The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

1:51:07.376 --> 1:51:09.674
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

1:51:14.216 --> 1:51:17.014
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

1:51:17.152 --> 1:51:20.280
<i>Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor?</i>

1:51:20.722 --> 1:51:22.849
<i>Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.</i>

1:51:23.225 --> 1:51:26.285
<i>Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

1:51:28.230 --> 1:51:29.527
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

1:51:29.898 --> 1:51:33.356
<i>Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

1:51:34.403 --> 1:51:36.701
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.</i>

1:51:38.173 --> 1:51:39.140
Good morning.

1:51:41.176 --> 1:51:42.871
Or should I say afternoon?

1:51:44.012 --> 1:51:45.036
Where am I?

1:51:45.847 --> 1:51:47.838
You're in a recovery room
in New York City.

1:51:49.751 --> 1:51:53.209
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!</i>

1:51:53.588 --> 1:51:55.385
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

1:51:55.757 --> 1:51:59.090
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

1:51:59.194 --> 1:52:00.422
Where am I really?

1:52:01.763 --> 1:52:03.731
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1:52:04.533 --> 1:52:05.830
The game.

1:52:06.034 --> 1:52:08.901
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

1:52:12.941 --> 1:52:14.909
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

1:52:15.477 --> 1:52:16.444
Where am I?

1:52:17.813 --> 1:52:19.110
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

1:52:26.755 --> 1:52:28.382
Captain Rogers, wait!

1:52:30.225 --> 1:52:31.920
All agents, code 13!

1:52:32.427 --> 1:52:35.260
<i>I repeat. All agents, code 13!</i>

1:52:55.917 --> 1:52:57.441
At ease, soldier!

1:53:06.027 --> 1:53:08.928
Look, I'm sorry about that little show
back there,

1:53:10.265 --> 1:53:13.234
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1:53:13.435 --> 1:53:14.732
Break what?

1:53:17.172 --> 1:53:18.799
You've been asleep, Cap.

1:53:19.307 --> 1:53:21.332
For almost 70 years.

1:53:35.957 --> 1:53:37.151
You gonna be okay?

1:53:38.293 --> 1:53:39.317
Yeah.

1:53:39.694 --> 1:53:40.991
Yeah, I just...

1:53:44.432 --> 1:53:45.922
I had a date.

2:03:07.595 --> 2:03:09.222
Trouble sleeping?

2:03:12.100 --> 2:03:13.397
You're here with a mission, sir?

2:03:14.368 --> 2:03:15.357
I am.

2:03:16.104 --> 2:03:17.901
Trying to get me back in the world?

2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:20.368
Trying to save it.

2:03:29.450 --> 2:03:31.213
<i>You think you're the only hero
in the world?</i>

2:03:45.466 --> 2:03:46.592
Gentlemen?

2:03:47.401 --> 2:03:48.459
You're up.

2:03:54.892 --> 2:03:55.859
Got a mean swing.
