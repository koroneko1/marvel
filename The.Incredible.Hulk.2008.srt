1
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:03,325
Is it ready.

2
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:18,896
<i>Hey!</i>

3
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,964
<i>That's a great punch.</i>

4
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:01,093
Let's work your breathing

5
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,186
Fear no good.

6
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:07,742
So emotion.

7
00:05:08,338 --> 00:05:09,266
Control.

8
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:25,305
Mossa

9
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,880
Breathe. Breathe.

10
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:40,740
Breathe.

11
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,980
Wait.

12
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,501
Hey! Hey!

13
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:40,528
Come on! Come on!

14
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:56,040
Ok.

15
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,722
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

16
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:06,810
to buy...

17
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:08,084
a...
new one.

18
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:08,574
A new.

19
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:12,206
Ok.

20
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,503
Ok.

21
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,125
No. No. No. Shut that off!

22
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,514
What happen?
Turn it off!

23
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,872
Watch out!

24
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,919
Turn it off!

25
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,238
Ok!

26
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,160
Work.

27
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:12,560
Martina.

28
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:20,885
You say?

29
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,437
No problem.

30
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:36,299
That's not right.

31
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:39,323
Hey! Stop! Stop!

32
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,003
Oh, you.

33
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:14,869
You see that? See that?

34
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:16,724
My ticket out of here.

35
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:52,319
Damn it!

36
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,726
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

37
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,929
It's a possible gamma sickness.

38
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:01,897
Milwaukee.

39
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,489
A man drank one of
those guarana sodas.

40
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:10,095
Guess it had a little more
kick than he was looking for.

41
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:18,403
Where was it bottled?

42
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,948
Porto Verde, Brazil.

43
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:23,893
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

44
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:27,208
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

45
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,848
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

46
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:53,934
And I pulled you one ace.

47
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:00,252
Emil Blonsky.

48
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:02,026
Born in Russia,

49
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:03,531
raised in England.

50
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:06,237
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

51
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:14,235
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

52
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:15,507
Glad I could help.

53
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:17,591
Just make it good.

54
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,090
<i>This is the target and the location.</i>

55
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:30,815
<i>Snatch and grab, live capture.</i>

56
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,806
<i>You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,</i>

57
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,791
<i>but live fire is for backup only.</i>

58
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,737
<i>We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.</i>

59
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:38,831
<i>Is he a fighter?</i>

60
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:43,875
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

61
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,209
who stole military secrets.

62
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,991
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

63
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:54,911
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

64
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,669
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

65
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,050
Tranq him...

66
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,002
bring him back.

67
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,127
Oh, come on.

68
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:48,358
Camera.

69
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:52,112
Here we go.

70
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,334
Get rid of the damn dog.

71
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,094
Take him!

72
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:32,170
Target's on the move.

73
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:42,453
Where is he?

74
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:50,068
He's on the ground.

75
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:50,955
Let's go!

76
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:52,143
Go!

77
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:55,079
Move, move!

78
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,114
Go, go, go!

79
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:21,048
Go! Go!

80
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:25,206
Clear everyone out!

81
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,245
Do not lose him!

82
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:15,071
No!

83
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:28,047
Get around behind him!

84
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:32,290
<i>Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.</i>

85
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:47,942
Oh, no.

86
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,693
You got to be kidding me.

87
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:23,120
<i>Where is he?</i>

88
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,418
Target acquired.

89
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:38,314
Gringo!

90
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:55,665
Let's go.

91
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:06,383
Hey gringo.

92
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:08,600
Gringo.

93
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:12,618
Please! No!

94
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:16,111
Not the computer!

95
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,618
No. Give me that!

96
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:18,878
No! No.

97
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:37,636
You bad angry, G?

98
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,169
<i>I very bad angry.</i>

99
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,047
Oh, no.

100
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,116
You don't understand!

101
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:48,927
Something really bad
is about to happen here!

102
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,441
Anybody else seeing this?

103
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,431
<i>We've got a bogey of some kind.</i>

104
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,105
<i>Please advise.</i>

105
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:48,276
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

106
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,418
<i>Do it now!</i>

107
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:59,736
Go live! Go live! Go live!

108
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:01,409
Move!
Get out of the way!

109
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,124
No!

110
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:38,494
It's behind us! Move! Move!

111
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:48,126
Get him!

112
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:51,215
Shoot! Shoot!

113
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,054
Leave me alone.

114
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,488
No! No!

115
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:35,037
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

116
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:37,212
He had it on him when he bolted.

117
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,180
Is that a girlfriend?

118
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:47,731
She helps him, maybe?

119
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:52,409
She is no longer a factor.

120
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,947
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

121
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,218
He wants to be alone.

122
00:26:59,063 --> 00:27:01,264
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

123
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,914
Forgive me, sir?

124
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,790
Doesn't anybody want to talk about
what went down in there?

125
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,734
Because...

126
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:17,671
He didn't lose us.

127
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:19,080
And he was not...

128
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:20,509
alone, sir.

129
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:23,482
We had him and then
something hit us, something...

130
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,036
Something...

131
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:27,162
big hit us!

132
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,313
It threw a forklift truck
like it was a softball!

133
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:35,421
It was the most...

134
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:37,940
powerful thing I've ever seen.

135
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,052
Well, it's gone.

136
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:44,336
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

137
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:45,971
I'm gonna track him down,

138
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:47,768
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

139
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,070
and I'm gonna...
That was Banner.

140
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:55,388
It...

141
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,694
was Banner.

142
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:00,192
You have to explain...

143
00:28:00,728 --> 00:28:03,033
that statement, sir.
No, I don't.

144
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,879
You've done a good job.

145
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:10,388
Pack up and get our men on a plane.

146
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:13,017
We're going home.

147
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,225
Wait.

148
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:21,973
Please.

149
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:30,582
Where am I?

150
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:09,303
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

151
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:11,873
I've seen good men go down
purely because someone...

152
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,205
didn't let us know what
we were walking into.

153
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,665
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

154
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:17,688
I mean, that's the job.

155
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,418
But this?

156
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:23,536
This is a whole new level of weird.

157
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,222
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

158
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,520
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

159
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,343
And, with respect,

160
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:34,135
you should be looking for a team
that's prepped and ready to fight,

161
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:35,654
because if that thing shows up again,

162
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:40,301
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

163
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:42,718
Sir.

164
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:34,548
Do you have more stretchy?

165
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,756
Yes.

166
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:39,655
Perfect.

167
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:12,779
Let me emphasize
that what I'm about to share with you

168
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:15,958
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

169
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:22,166
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development program.

170
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:25,926
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

171
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:28,802
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

172
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,026
Yeah, Super Soldier.

173
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:34,795
Yes.

174
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:38,098
An oversimplification, but yes.

175
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:40,200
And I dusted it off,

176
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,710
got them doing serious
work again, bold work.

177
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,888
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

178
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:47,626
We were trying to make you better.

179
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,294
Banner's work was very early phase.

180
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:56,575
It wasn't even weapons application.

181
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:59,328
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

182
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:01,945
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

183
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:06,749
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

184
00:33:07,372 --> 00:33:10,262
And something went very wrong.

185
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,356
Or it went very right.

186
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:18,894
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

187
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:22,407
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

188
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:23,164
No.

189
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,608
But you were. You were, weren't you?

190
00:33:24,728 --> 00:33:26,405
You were trying other things.

191
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,798
One serum...

192
00:33:28,564 --> 00:33:29,906
we developed,

193
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,361
was very promising.

194
00:33:32,363 --> 00:33:33,401
So why did he run?

195
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,980
He's a scientist.

196
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:38,162
He is not one of us.

197
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,542
Blonsky, how old are you? 45?

198
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:45,735
39.

199
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:47,979
It takes a toll, doesn't it?

200
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:49,467
Yes, it does.

201
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,463
So get out of the trenches.

202
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,966
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

203
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:55,194
No, I'm a fighter.

204
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:57,750
I'll be one for as long as I can.

205
00:33:58,387 --> 00:34:01,432
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

206
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,640
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

207
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:08,729
I could probably arrange
something like that.

208
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:31,674
Take care, kids.

209
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:44,760
Stan, I give you my word,

210
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:46,750
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

211
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:49,726
I know it. I always knew it.

212
00:36:50,037 --> 00:36:52,131
I mean, you know
how I felt about you two.

213
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:57,093
Have you talked to her?

214
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:57,953
No.

215
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,211
She doesn't know that I'm here.

216
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,977
She's with somebody?

217
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,765
Yeah, he's a head shrink.

218
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:09,137
They say he's one of the best.

219
00:37:09,412 --> 00:37:10,790
But a really nice guy.

220
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,285
Good. That's good.

221
00:37:15,656 --> 00:37:16,481
Bruce,

222
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,065
what can I do to help you?

223
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:19,978
I could use a bed for a few nights.

224
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,798
You can have the spare room upstairs.

225
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,451
That'd be so great.

226
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,097
There is...

227
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:28,479
There is one other thing.

228
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,714
Excuse me. Pardon me.

229
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,951
Coming through.

230
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,713
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

231
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:46,431
I don't think there is anybody up there.

232
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,802
Oh, man.

233
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:50,691
I'm gonna catch hell if I don't collect.
You got to let me try.

234
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:53,666
I'll tell you what.

235
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:55,198
I got an extra medium.

236
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:56,629
Take it on the house.

237
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:04,526
You are the man.

238
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:06,742
God bless you, brother.

239
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:10,544
Alright.

240
00:39:07,988 --> 00:39:08,908
Ok.

241
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:25,023
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

242
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,526
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

243
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:30,403
Kids.

244
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,031
I got nothing but marinara now.

245
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:35,087
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

246
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,353
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

247
00:40:45,132 --> 00:40:45,933
Stan?

248
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:48,685
And he...

249
00:40:48,788 --> 00:40:50,797
I go, so, so yeah, I mean...

250
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:52,131
where were you?

251
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:53,989
I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil.

252
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:56,249
And he goes, not where you been at.

253
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:58,518
I thought, Oh, my God.

254
00:40:58,754 --> 00:41:00,725
I just felt so awful.

255
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:29,048
Bruce?

256
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:36,948
Betty?

257
00:41:38,105 --> 00:41:39,365
What's going on?

258
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:55,356
Betty...

259
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:56,692
Just tell me,

260
00:41:57,029 --> 00:41:58,862
if I saw what I think I saw.

261
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,493
I don't know what to say.

262
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:03,873
Please, just tell me the truth.

263
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:46,038
Don't go.

264
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:47,788
Don't go.

265
00:42:57,676 --> 00:42:59,271
I want you to come with me now.

266
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,930
Please. Come with me.

267
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,249
Please.

268
00:43:34,754 --> 00:43:35,760
It's our data.

269
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:39,843
I got in there before
they carted it all away.

270
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,340
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

271
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:50,029
Does the General know
that you have this?

272
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:50,792
No.

273
00:43:51,292 --> 00:43:52,230
I don't think so.

274
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,567
I haven't spoken to him
in a couple of years.

275
00:43:55,587 --> 00:43:56,654
You have to be sure.

276
00:43:57,118 --> 00:43:57,862
Bruce,

277
00:43:58,162 --> 00:44:02,073
I don't understand why we can't just go
in there together and talk to him.

278
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,326
He told me,

279
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:05,398
what he wanted to do.

280
00:44:05,647 --> 00:44:07,316
He wants it out of me.

281
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:09,934
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

282
00:44:10,694 --> 00:44:12,167
He wants to make it a weapon.

283
00:45:04,886 --> 00:45:06,221
Hi.
Hi.

284
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:08,107
I...

285
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:10,441
I thought you might want to...

286
00:45:10,443 --> 00:45:11,228
Thanks.

287
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:13,987
Listen...

288
00:45:14,357 --> 00:45:16,690
I should leave early, as early as I can.

289
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:17,407
Really?

290
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:19,621
You can't stay at all?

291
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:22,679
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

292
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:28,115
If I could borrow some cash?

293
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:28,928
Of course.

294
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,014
I need to take a bus.

295
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:32,984
Well, at least let me
walk you to the station.

296
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:36,091
Ok.

297
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,793
You have everything you need?
Yeah.

298
00:45:46,052 --> 00:45:47,053
I...

299
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:49,514
What?

300
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:53,416
Good night.
Good night.

301
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,388
I hope you get some rest.

302
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:40,472
We're giving you
a very low dose only.

303
00:46:41,192 --> 00:46:43,294
I need you sharp out there
and disciplined.

304
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:45,952
First sign of any side effect,

305
00:46:45,954 --> 00:46:49,206
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

306
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:52,147
Agreed?
Agreed.

307
00:46:56,205 --> 00:46:58,092
You'll get two separate infusions.

308
00:46:58,878 --> 00:47:00,364
One into the deep muscle,

309
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,721
one into the bone marrow centers.

310
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:04,759
The bone ones are going to hurt.

311
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,295
Is everything ok?

312
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,732
I think so.

313
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:06,575
Come here.

314
00:48:08,673 --> 00:48:10,088
I just wanna do this.

315
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,481
It's better like that.
Yeah?

316
00:48:18,871 --> 00:48:20,331
It feels too tight enough.

317
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,826
Yeah, a little.
Ok.

318
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:30,303
What?

319
00:48:31,832 --> 00:48:32,646
They're here.

320
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,288
Betty, look at me, look at me!
Bruce!

321
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:35,816
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

322
00:48:35,847 --> 00:48:37,348
Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
Bruce!

323
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:50,735
Damn it! We'd have had snipers
on target in three more minutes.

324
00:48:50,737 --> 00:48:52,280
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

325
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:55,783
He's heading 2-7-0.

326
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:14,081
Blonsky! Not yet!

327
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:16,664
Sir.

328
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:20,475
Look alive. This could get interesting.

329
00:50:08,648 --> 00:50:09,649
I got him!

330
00:50:09,857 --> 00:50:10,622
Stop!

331
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:12,872
Stop!

332
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:16,114
I know you're in there!

333
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,234
General, please!

334
00:50:22,578 --> 00:50:23,207
Sir?

335
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:24,997
Dad!

336
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:34,163
Dad, please don't do this.

337
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:36,507
You can't see this clearly.
Now, get inside.

338
00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:37,556
There he is!

339
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:40,433
Target is in the overpass.
We have a visual.

340
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:42,890
Do not engage!
Repeat, do not engage!

341
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:49,784
He's locked in.

342
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:57,738
Put two canisters in there with him.

343
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,087
Fire!

344
00:51:18,718 --> 00:51:19,719
Get her back here!

345
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:55,296
Now she'll see.

346
00:52:18,152 --> 00:52:19,194
Alpha team?

347
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,240
Let him have all of it.

348
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,122
Come on, light him up!

349
00:52:33,334 --> 00:52:36,203
Where are the fifty cals?
Move your asses!

350
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:26,053
Oh, my God!

351
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:30,804
Blonsky, now you're up!

352
00:53:31,434 --> 00:53:32,228
Sir?

353
00:53:33,728 --> 00:53:34,651
Cover me.

354
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,202
Remember me?

355
00:54:14,602 --> 00:54:16,201
My God, he's doing it.

356
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:22,401
Move him toward the cannons!

357
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:29,533
Move!

358
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,382
Hold your position!

359
00:54:44,465 --> 00:54:45,800
Do it now!

360
00:55:11,659 --> 00:55:13,160
Please, please, please, no!

361
00:55:13,162 --> 00:55:14,580
Please, please, please!
Get her back!

362
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:15,788
You're killing him!

363
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:17,886
Stop! Get off of me!

364
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,708
Bruce!

365
00:55:22,837 --> 00:55:24,782
Bruce!

366
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:26,928
Bruce!

367
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,163
Where's the gunship?

368
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:18,350
Is that it?

369
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:20,394
Blonsky, pull back now.

370
00:56:20,396 --> 00:56:21,280
<i>Pull back!</i>

371
00:56:24,899 --> 00:56:26,096
Is that all you got?

372
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,827
Fall back!
Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

373
00:56:36,856 --> 00:56:37,760
Find cover!

374
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:43,211
Betty!

375
00:56:56,865 --> 00:56:58,325
Fire, goddamn it!

376
00:57:00,158 --> 00:57:01,238
Bruce?

377
00:57:14,657 --> 00:57:15,908
Stop firing!

378
00:57:29,463 --> 00:57:30,881
No!

379
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,603
You did the right thing, calling us.

380
00:58:25,584 --> 00:58:27,036
I need to know where they're going.

381
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:30,722
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

382
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:31,668
From who?

383
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,173
He protected her.

384
00:58:34,462 --> 00:58:35,697
You almost killed her.

385
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:39,173
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

386
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,285
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

387
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:44,470
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

388
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,609
And you are.

389
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:49,580
I don't know where he's going.

390
00:58:51,224 --> 00:58:52,900
I know she'll help him, if she can.

391
00:58:52,902 --> 00:58:54,554
Then she's aiding a fugitive.

392
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:58,162
And I can't help either one of them.

393
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,441
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

394
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:08,637
Now I know!

395
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:15,630
Where does she meet these guys?

396
01:00:05,953 --> 01:00:06,830
Bruce?

397
01:00:17,297 --> 01:00:18,367
Bruce.

398
01:00:38,652 --> 01:00:39,553
It's ok.

399
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,931
It's ok.

400
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:54,957
Come here.

401
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,754
Come this way.

402
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:00,875
Watch your head.

403
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:29,923
We're ok.

404
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,876
It's ok.

405
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:39,388
It's just the rain.

406
01:01:48,889 --> 01:01:50,475
Will he ever walk again?

407
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:53,760
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

408
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:56,047
I will say this for him.

409
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:57,938
He's got a heart like a machine.

410
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,734
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

411
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:05,632
Here.

412
01:03:07,134 --> 01:03:08,135
Ok.

413
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:49,788
Bruce?

414
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,775
Oh, hi.

415
01:03:53,513 --> 01:03:54,505
Are you ok?

416
01:03:55,189 --> 01:03:55,975
Yeah.

417
01:03:56,642 --> 01:03:58,257
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

418
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:01,521
Good.
I just had to get my data back.

419
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:03,774
You ate it?

420
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:05,456
Well, you know,

421
01:04:05,826 --> 01:04:08,412
the circumstances called
for a little improvisation.

422
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:14,621
Ok, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

423
01:04:15,556 --> 01:04:16,487
First thing's first.

424
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:19,445
Oh, you're kidding me.

425
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:31,021
What?

426
01:04:31,885 --> 01:04:32,610
No. No.

427
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:34,764
They were the stretchiest pair they had.

428
01:04:34,766 --> 01:04:36,101
I'll take my chances.

429
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:38,709
<i>Rumors continue
to swirl about a violent clash</i>

430
01:04:38,711 --> 01:04:42,689
<i>between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary</i>

431
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:45,706
<i>on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.</i>

432
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:49,103
<i>Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.</i>

433
01:04:49,105 --> 01:04:50,640
<i>It was so big.</i>

434
01:04:50,643 --> 01:04:53,563
<i>It was like this huge, like Hulk!
Yeah.</i>

435
01:04:53,646 --> 01:04:56,691
<i>McGhee, who happens to be
a reporter for the campus paper,</i>

436
01:04:56,868 --> 01:04:58,537
<i>captured this on his cell phone.</i>

437
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,330
<i>Further search for the mysterious Hulk</i>

438
01:05:00,344 --> 01:05:04,890
<i>was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.</i>

439
01:05:12,467 --> 01:05:14,042
Not too short back there.

440
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,292
I have done this before, you know.

441
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:36,450
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

442
01:05:36,452 --> 01:05:38,224
With clippers, usually.

443
01:06:33,149 --> 01:06:35,860
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
What? What?

444
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,075
We can't do this.

445
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:39,638
It's ok. I want to.
No.

446
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:41,524
No.

447
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,842
I can't.

448
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:49,374
I can't get too excited.

449
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:54,011
Not even a little excited?

450
01:06:57,197 --> 01:06:58,417
It's ok.

451
01:07:03,245 --> 01:07:05,122
Sir, it's Blonsky.

452
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:09,990
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

453
01:07:11,242 --> 01:07:12,694
Ask him yourself.

454
01:07:16,698 --> 01:07:17,511
Sir?

455
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:40,056
Good to see you back
on your feet, soldier.

456
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,378
Thank you, sir.

457
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:50,237
How do you feel?

458
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:54,367
Pissed off and ready for round three.

459
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:01,801
Basically,

460
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:03,218
we can't use any of this,

461
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,713
because they can track all of it.

462
01:08:05,046 --> 01:08:07,340
Well, my lip gloss?
Can they track that?

463
01:08:08,864 --> 01:08:11,029
No. You can take your lip gloss.

464
01:08:11,031 --> 01:08:11,952
Thank you.

465
01:08:12,042 --> 01:08:13,289
Well, I need my glasses.

466
01:08:14,273 --> 01:08:16,318
Well, you can take your glasses
and your watch, ok?

467
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,227
We can use most of it.

468
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:19,950
We just can't use the credit cards,
the ID or the phone.

469
01:08:19,972 --> 01:08:21,134
Don't even turn that on.

470
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:21,877
Ok.

471
01:08:22,344 --> 01:08:24,352
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

472
01:08:24,587 --> 01:08:27,886
How will we get where we need
to go on $40 and no credit cards?

473
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:33,505
Well, we could sell this.

474
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:35,255
No.

475
01:08:35,515 --> 01:08:38,075
No, that's the only thing you have
left from her. No.

476
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:42,014
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

477
01:08:43,771 --> 01:08:45,718
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

478
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,973
plastic and Dr. Ross's web accounts,

479
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:50,338
and local PD have been placed on alert.

480
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:53,087
They'll pop up somewhere and when
they do, it comes straight to us.

481
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:54,941
They're not gonna just pop up.

482
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:58,318
He made it five years and got across
borders without making any mistakes.

483
01:08:58,338 --> 01:09:00,174
He's not gonna use
a damn credit card now.

484
01:09:00,654 --> 01:09:02,447
If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.

485
01:09:02,506 --> 01:09:03,738
He's not trying to escape this time.

486
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,829
He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.

487
01:09:06,326 --> 01:09:08,857
We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.

488
01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:10,695
You all have copies
of the correspondence.

489
01:09:11,164 --> 01:09:13,251
The aliases Mr. Green and Mr. Blue

490
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:15,465
have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.

491
01:09:16,254 --> 01:09:18,166
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.

492
01:09:18,974 --> 01:09:20,607
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.

493
01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:23,638
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.

494
01:10:06,853 --> 01:10:07,479
Hey.

495
01:10:09,931 --> 01:10:10,896
Smile.

496
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:22,791
What is it like?

497
01:10:25,155 --> 01:10:27,134
When it happens,
what do you experience?

498
01:10:28,572 --> 01:10:31,116
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

499
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:32,912
Those induced hallucinations?

500
01:10:34,164 --> 01:10:35,279
It's a lot like that,

501
01:10:35,374 --> 01:10:37,678
just a thousand times amplified.

502
01:10:39,419 --> 01:10:42,236
It's like someone's poured
a liter of acid into my brain.

503
01:10:43,423 --> 01:10:45,221
Do you remember, anything?

504
01:10:45,598 --> 01:10:48,338
Just fragments. Images.

505
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,632
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

506
01:10:51,925 --> 01:10:54,164
But then it's still you, inside it.

507
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,617
No. No, it's not.

508
01:10:58,021 --> 01:10:58,834
I don't know.

509
01:10:59,093 --> 01:11:02,134
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

510
01:11:02,861 --> 01:11:04,377
Maybe your mind is in there,

511
01:11:04,436 --> 01:11:07,022
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

512
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:08,390
I don't want to control it.

513
01:11:08,907 --> 01:11:10,255
I want to get rid of it.

514
01:11:23,671 --> 01:11:24,779
Are you ready?

515
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,638
Let's even the playing field a little.

516
01:11:30,308 --> 01:11:31,008
Gentlemen.

517
01:11:35,612 --> 01:11:36,636
Bruce, wake up.

518
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:39,120
There's something going on.

519
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:51,154
We got to go.

520
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,052
Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

521
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:10,074
Alright. Come.

522
01:12:24,357 --> 01:12:26,009
It is a long way uptown.

523
01:12:26,073 --> 01:12:28,101
I think the subway's probably quickest.

524
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:31,500
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

525
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:33,841
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

526
01:12:33,966 --> 01:12:36,134
Right. Let's get a cab.

527
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,067
Come on, now! Let's go!

528
01:12:39,069 --> 01:12:40,973
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

529
01:12:46,004 --> 01:12:47,589
Very nice. You see her?
Oh, my.

530
01:12:47,591 --> 01:12:50,177
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

531
01:12:50,884 --> 01:12:52,643
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

532
01:12:56,222 --> 01:12:58,298
Are you! Are you out of your mind?

533
01:12:58,933 --> 01:13:00,391
What is wrong with you?
What's the matter, baby?

534
01:13:00,393 --> 01:13:01,452
You don't like a good ride?

535
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:05,190
Asshole!

536
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:10,820
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

537
01:13:10,822 --> 01:13:13,350
manage that anger very effectively.
You zip it.

538
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:15,181
We're walking.

539
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:16,342
Ok.

540
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:25,671
Excuse me. Dr. Sterns?

541
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,237
Yes.
I'm sorry to bother you.

542
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:28,627
I'm Elizabeth Ross.

543
01:13:30,384 --> 01:13:31,435
Dr. Ross!

544
01:13:31,567 --> 01:13:33,336
I have someone who'd like to meet you.

545
01:13:33,728 --> 01:13:34,526
Ok.

546
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,480
It's Mr. Blue, isn't it?

547
01:13:40,331 --> 01:13:41,325
Mr. Green?

548
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,588
I got to tell you, I've been
wondering if you were even real.

549
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:49,416
And if you were, what would it look like?

550
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:50,908
A person with that much...

551
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,435
power...

552
01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:54,080
lurking in him.

553
01:13:54,318 --> 01:13:56,411
Nothing could have
surprised me more than this

554
01:13:56,413 --> 01:13:58,733
unassuming man shaking my hand.

555
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:01,578
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

556
01:14:01,788 --> 01:14:03,385
Even if everything goes perfectly,

557
01:14:03,581 --> 01:14:07,460
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

558
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:10,200
is that going to be a lasting cure,

559
01:14:10,421 --> 01:14:13,800
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

560
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,040
I don't know.

561
01:14:18,168 --> 01:14:19,348
What I'm saying is...

562
01:14:19,836 --> 01:14:22,967
if we overshoot this by even
the smallest integer

563
01:14:23,848 --> 01:14:25,029
we're dealing with...

564
01:14:25,236 --> 01:14:28,753
concentrations with
extraordinary levels of toxicity.

565
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:30,050
So...
You mean it could kill him.

566
01:14:30,104 --> 01:14:31,112
Kill him? Yeah.

567
01:14:32,449 --> 01:14:33,409
I should say so.

568
01:14:35,052 --> 01:14:37,138
You should know that there is
a flip side to this, too.

569
01:14:37,276 --> 01:14:38,506
If we miss on the low side,

570
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:40,609
if we induce me and it fails,

571
01:14:40,954 --> 01:14:42,716
this will be very dangerous for you.

572
01:14:45,178 --> 01:14:45,902
Look.

573
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:48,856
I've always been more curious
than cautious,

574
01:14:49,272 --> 01:14:50,947
and that's served me pretty well.

575
01:14:51,017 --> 01:14:51,533
So...

576
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:53,502
are we going to do this?

577
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:49,921
How you feeling, man?

578
01:15:52,065 --> 01:15:53,242
Like a monster.

579
01:16:13,523 --> 01:16:14,821
Ok. On the table.

580
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:18,634
These will protect you
from yourself if...

581
01:16:19,393 --> 01:16:21,542
you have a strong reaction.

582
01:16:22,802 --> 01:16:24,968
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

583
01:16:30,268 --> 01:16:34,195
Come on! Stupid graduate students.

584
01:16:38,903 --> 01:16:39,620
Ok.

585
01:16:40,613 --> 01:16:42,073
You, you, you.

586
01:16:43,676 --> 01:16:44,860
This will be a somewhat...

587
01:16:45,578 --> 01:16:46,864
novel sensation.

588
01:16:49,742 --> 01:16:50,868
We have begun.

589
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:56,022
The dialysis machine will mix
the antidote with your blood.

590
01:16:56,295 --> 01:16:59,929
So the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

591
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,009
Just relax.

592
01:17:02,802 --> 01:17:04,856
Ok. We are...

593
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:06,426
comprehensive.

594
01:17:09,308 --> 01:17:10,039
Here.

595
01:17:20,778 --> 01:17:21,466
Alright.

596
01:17:21,765 --> 01:17:22,944
We set to pop?

597
01:17:25,283 --> 01:17:26,789
I'd take your hands off him.

598
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:49,128
Oh, my God!

599
01:18:03,404 --> 01:18:04,939
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

600
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,795
Now. Ok, now!
Wait.

601
01:18:18,797 --> 01:18:19,863
Now, do it!

602
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,469
Do it!

603
01:18:29,013 --> 01:18:30,710
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

604
01:18:31,599 --> 01:18:33,923
Stay with me. The antidote, now!

605
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:36,116
Sterns, do it now!

606
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:38,633
Bruce, look at me.

607
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:39,531
Look in my eyes.

608
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:41,569
Please, look in my eyes.

609
01:18:42,191 --> 01:18:43,576
Fuck! What the fuck.

610
01:19:04,799 --> 01:19:05,606
Bruce.

611
01:19:06,092 --> 01:19:07,340
Oh, my God.

612
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:19,688
Bruce?

613
01:19:20,573 --> 01:19:21,928
Bruce, can you hear me?

614
01:19:25,788 --> 01:19:26,701
Bruce?

615
01:19:35,913 --> 01:19:36,642
It's ok.

616
01:19:36,987 --> 01:19:39,027
You're ok. You're ok.

617
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:43,673
You did it.

618
01:19:44,255 --> 01:19:44,967
He's fine.

619
01:19:45,597 --> 01:19:47,579
This is fantastic.
It's over.

620
01:19:49,223 --> 01:19:49,962
Hi.

621
01:19:50,678 --> 01:19:51,450
Hi.

622
01:20:00,068 --> 01:20:01,815
That was the most,

623
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:06,191
extraordinary thing I have seen
in my entire life!

624
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:07,737
Ok, you know what? Stop, please.

625
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,239
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

626
01:20:10,276 --> 01:20:11,312
Absolutely. Ok.

627
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,940
The gamma pulse came
from the amygdala.

628
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,977
I think Dr. Ross's primer...
Are you ok?

629
01:20:15,995 --> 01:20:19,127
Lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

630
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:22,176
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

631
01:20:22,211 --> 01:20:24,847
Now, maybe we've neutralized
those cells permanently,

632
01:20:24,849 --> 01:20:26,726
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

633
01:20:27,006 --> 01:20:29,383
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

634
01:20:29,385 --> 01:20:31,178
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

635
01:20:31,344 --> 01:20:32,970
Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
Wait, wait.

636
01:20:33,054 --> 01:20:33,756
What did you just say?

637
01:20:33,838 --> 01:20:35,664
They weren't getting
the myostatin primer...

638
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:36,792
No, no, no. Test subjects?

639
01:20:37,993 --> 01:20:39,172
What test subjects?

640
01:20:40,556 --> 01:20:41,477
Come with me.

641
01:20:58,746 --> 01:20:59,982
What's the activity level?

642
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:01,696
Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

643
01:21:03,501 --> 01:21:04,919
<i>We started on rats and mice,</i>

644
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:07,507
<i>but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.</i>

645
01:21:07,838 --> 01:21:09,766
And we still don't know
which is more toxic,

646
01:21:09,768 --> 01:21:10,996
the gamma or your blood.

647
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:11,729
What do you mean, my blood?

648
01:21:13,145 --> 01:21:14,870
Bruce, this is all you.

649
01:21:15,638 --> 01:21:18,988
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

650
01:21:19,725 --> 01:21:22,771
With a little more trial and error,
there is no end to what we can do!

651
01:21:23,007 --> 01:21:25,737
This is potentially Olympian!

652
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:29,994
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

653
01:21:30,397 --> 01:21:32,227
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

654
01:21:32,571 --> 01:21:35,700
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

655
01:21:49,745 --> 01:21:51,378
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

656
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,605
Wait, what?
All of it.

657
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,361
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

658
01:21:55,363 --> 01:21:56,409
Is this the whole supply?

659
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,207
What...

660
01:21:57,763 --> 01:21:59,348
We could get the Nobel for this!

661
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:01,621
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

662
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:04,266
It is too dangerous.
It cannot be controlled.

663
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,420
At your discretion, shooter.

664
01:22:06,503 --> 01:22:08,331
<i>Three of us!
This is Promethean fire.</i>

665
01:22:08,344 --> 01:22:08,895
<i>It's just...</i>

666
01:22:09,275 --> 01:22:09,863
<i>No shot.</i>

667
01:22:13,848 --> 01:22:14,981
Blonsky's going in.

668
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:18,902
Blonsky, stand down.

669
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:20,255
My daughter's in there!

670
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:24,415
We have the antidote now.

671
01:22:24,498 --> 01:22:27,420
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

672
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:36,349
And if we let it go,
we will never get it back.

673
01:22:36,382 --> 01:22:38,384
<i>You don't know how
powerful this thing is.</i>

674
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:40,637
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

675
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,866
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

676
01:22:50,156 --> 01:22:51,450
Bruce! Bruce!

677
01:22:53,361 --> 01:22:54,346
Get out.

678
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,737
Where is it?

679
01:22:59,459 --> 01:23:00,702
Come on, where is it?

680
01:23:04,955 --> 01:23:06,130
Show him to me.

681
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:09,075
Blonsky!

682
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:18,555
Miss!

683
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:21,429
Take this.

684
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:29,295
If you took it from me, I'm gonna put you
in a hole for the rest of your life.

685
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:36,667
Betty.

686
01:23:38,906 --> 01:23:41,185
I will never forgive
what you've done to him.

687
01:23:41,945 --> 01:23:42,999
He's a fugitive.

688
01:23:43,347 --> 01:23:45,308
You made him a fugitive

689
01:23:45,391 --> 01:23:48,895
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

690
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,171
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

691
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,905
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

692
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,473
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

693
01:24:04,475 --> 01:24:05,849
No! Not yet.

694
01:24:05,851 --> 01:24:07,676
I sorted out a few pieces,

695
01:24:07,678 --> 01:24:09,244
but it's not like I can put together

696
01:24:09,246 --> 01:24:12,305
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

697
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,682
He was a freak accident!

698
01:24:14,684 --> 01:24:16,569
The goal is to do it better!

699
01:24:16,777 --> 01:24:17,982
So Banner's the only...

700
01:24:22,334 --> 01:24:23,950
She's an annoying bitch.

701
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:27,002
Why are you always hitting people?

702
01:24:29,373 --> 01:24:30,972
Now what possibly...

703
01:24:31,227 --> 01:24:34,147
could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

704
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:36,556
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

705
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:39,472
I want what you got out of Banner.

706
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:40,467
I want that.

707
01:24:44,099 --> 01:24:47,386
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

708
01:24:49,424 --> 01:24:50,366
I want more.

709
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:53,152
You've seen what he becomes, right?

710
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:54,922
I have.

711
01:24:56,025 --> 01:24:57,294
And it's beautiful.

712
01:24:58,272 --> 01:24:59,356
Godlike.

713
01:24:59,825 --> 01:25:00,990
Well, I want that.

714
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,430
I need that. Make me that.

715
01:25:06,577 --> 01:25:09,164
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

716
01:25:09,788 --> 01:25:10,935
The mix could be...

717
01:25:11,999 --> 01:25:13,312
an abomination.

718
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:18,450
I didn't say...

719
01:25:18,663 --> 01:25:20,125
I was unwilling.

720
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,212
I just need informed consent.

721
01:25:26,808 --> 01:25:28,275
And you've given it.

722
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:13,694
This is what I was trying to explain.

723
01:26:14,103 --> 01:26:18,299
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

724
01:26:19,108 --> 01:26:21,063
But clearly it worked.

725
01:26:21,183 --> 01:26:24,853
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

726
01:26:24,989 --> 01:26:26,952
but if you'll just...

727
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:29,463
get back on the table,

728
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:30,702
I can...

729
01:26:31,531 --> 01:26:32,433
fix this.

730
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:48,076
Shoot it!

731
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:49,164
Hey!

732
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:50,483
No!

733
01:27:00,524 --> 01:27:01,700
Delta 4 to Leader.

734
01:27:02,572 --> 01:27:04,405
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

735
01:27:04,445 --> 01:27:06,237
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

736
01:27:10,034 --> 01:27:12,241
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

737
01:27:20,294 --> 01:27:21,482
It's over there!

738
01:27:22,663 --> 01:27:23,442
Drop them!

739
01:27:24,923 --> 01:27:25,684
What is that thing?

740
01:27:25,686 --> 01:27:26,640
Shoot it!

741
01:27:36,643 --> 01:27:37,995
Ok. Alright! You...

742
01:27:37,997 --> 01:27:40,440
You, drive! Let's go! Move, move!

743
01:27:40,522 --> 01:27:41,857
Delta 4 to Leader!
Go, go, go, go, go!

744
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,772
Something big
just went off down here!

745
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:45,836
General, you should hear this!

746
01:27:46,612 --> 01:27:49,531
<i>The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!</i>

747
01:27:52,117 --> 01:27:54,220
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

748
01:27:54,286 --> 01:27:56,246
You get it together.
What is your position?

749
01:27:56,455 --> 01:27:57,830
121st Street,

750
01:27:57,832 --> 01:27:59,612
<i>heading north on Broadway!</i>

751
01:27:59,614 --> 01:28:00,747
Turn us around.

752
01:28:08,175 --> 01:28:09,094
We're going back.

753
01:28:09,096 --> 01:28:10,359
Why are we going back?

754
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:13,138
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

755
01:28:13,514 --> 01:28:14,490
Yes, sir!

756
01:28:16,809 --> 01:28:18,357
What the hell was that?

757
01:28:19,103 --> 01:28:20,572
Go, go, go!

758
01:28:44,114 --> 01:28:44,953
No!

759
01:29:01,609 --> 01:29:02,724
One of yours?

760
01:29:03,355 --> 01:29:04,548
Oh, my God.

761
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,544
What have you done?

762
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:10,612
Fire at him, fire at him!

763
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,727
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

764
01:29:17,453 --> 01:29:18,347
Come on!

765
01:29:22,207 --> 01:29:23,375
Sweet.

766
01:29:26,213 --> 01:29:27,323
Booyah!

767
01:29:45,434 --> 01:29:46,899
Get out of there, soldier!

768
01:29:50,235 --> 01:29:51,602
Stacy!

769
01:30:22,398 --> 01:30:24,358
Give me a real fight!

770
01:30:32,283 --> 01:30:33,112
Sir?

771
01:30:36,057 --> 01:30:36,917
Sir?

772
01:30:38,992 --> 01:30:41,173
Tell them to bring everything
they've got and head for Harlem.

773
01:30:45,281 --> 01:30:46,194
It has to be me.

774
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:48,962
You have to take me back there.

775
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:50,372
What are you saying?

776
01:30:50,879 --> 01:30:52,172
You think you can control it?

777
01:30:52,174 --> 01:30:53,743
No, no, not control it, but,

778
01:30:53,988 --> 01:30:55,133
I don't know, maybe aim it.

779
01:30:55,326 --> 01:30:56,739
And what if you can't?

780
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,734
We made this thing.

781
01:31:00,604 --> 01:31:01,403
All of us.

782
01:31:03,058 --> 01:31:03,838
Please.

783
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:10,321
Land us near it.
No, no.

784
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:11,744
No, keep us high.

785
01:31:13,136 --> 01:31:14,487
Open the back door.

786
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:22,327
Bruce! Bruce, stop!

787
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:24,439
Stop! What are you doing?

788
01:31:25,372 --> 01:31:26,472
Think about this!

789
01:31:26,989 --> 01:31:29,080
You don't even know if you'll change!

790
01:31:30,933 --> 01:31:32,221
You don't have to do this!

791
01:31:32,223 --> 01:31:33,827
Please, this is insane!

792
01:31:34,263 --> 01:31:35,579
Betty, I've got to try.

793
01:31:38,343 --> 01:31:39,184
I'm sorry.

794
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,315
Oh, shit!

795
01:32:07,998 --> 01:32:09,272
Get her in here!

796
01:32:09,913 --> 01:32:10,934
Come on, miss.

797
01:32:28,226 --> 01:32:29,649
There. Betty!

798
01:32:49,252 --> 01:32:49,879
Hulk!

799
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:56,991
Yeah!

800
01:33:41,633 --> 01:33:42,829
Come on!

801
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,674
Is that all you've got?

802
01:34:30,849 --> 01:34:32,522
Use that thing, soldier!

803
01:34:32,524 --> 01:34:33,603
Give him some help!

804
01:34:33,605 --> 01:34:34,724
Which one?

805
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:37,437
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

806
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:38,861
Cut the other one in half!

807
01:34:41,985 --> 01:34:42,676
Ross!

808
01:35:07,886 --> 01:35:09,290
Keep it on him!

809
01:35:37,874 --> 01:35:39,355
Look, I got to put it down!

810
01:35:39,623 --> 01:35:40,710
Hang on!

811
01:36:48,111 --> 01:36:49,045
Dad?

812
01:36:51,823 --> 01:36:52,835
Are you hurt?

813
01:36:52,837 --> 01:36:54,014
Let me help you.

814
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:03,051
I'm alright.

815
01:37:03,053 --> 01:37:04,394
Just find a way out.

816
01:37:51,841 --> 01:37:54,415
You don't deserve this power!

817
01:37:55,549 --> 01:37:58,236
Now watch her die!

818
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,282
Look out!

819
01:39:21,681 --> 01:39:22,789
General?

820
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:31,500
Any last words?

821
01:39:34,611 --> 01:39:35,824
Hulk...

822
01:39:36,711 --> 01:39:37,990
smash!

823
01:40:25,537 --> 01:40:26,549
Stop!

824
01:41:47,869 --> 01:41:48,971
It's ok.

825
01:41:59,339 --> 01:42:01,007
Betty.

826
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:30,042
Reload.

827
01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:38,919
Reload.

828
01:44:54,966 --> 01:44:57,865
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

829
01:44:58,268 --> 01:45:00,077
You know I hate to say,
I told you so General,

830
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:03,342
but that Super Soldier program
was put on ice for a reason.

831
01:45:04,638 --> 01:45:07,088
I've always felt hardware
was more reliable.

832
01:45:07,819 --> 01:45:08,764
Stark.

833
01:45:09,445 --> 01:45:10,277
General.

834
01:45:12,354 --> 01:45:14,623
You always wear such nice suits.

835
01:45:15,855 --> 01:45:16,649
