00:48.800 --> 00:50.165
On your left.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.175
On your left.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.248
On my left. Got it.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.415
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.010
- On your left.
- Come on!

01:21.840 --> 01:23.410
Need a medic?

01:26.120 --> 01:27.895
I need a new set of lungs.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.242
Dude, you just ran,
like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.

01:31.360 --> 01:32.440
I guess I got a late start.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.046
Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.766
You should take another lap.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.008
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.766
What unit you with?

01:41.960 --> 01:43.325
58th Pararescue.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.045
But now I'm working down at the VA.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.364
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.682
I kind of put that together.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.326
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.886
It takes some getting used to.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.451
It's good to meet you, Sam.

01:57.880 --> 01:58.881
It's your bed, right?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.042
What's that?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.645
Your bed, it's too soft.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.450
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

02:04.680 --> 02:06.569
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.883
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...

02:10.000 --> 02:11.240
Lying on a marshmallow.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.080
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.695
How long?

02:15.720 --> 02:17.006
Two tours.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.520
You must miss the good old days, huh?

02:20.440 --> 02:22.886
Well, things aren't so bad.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.535
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.895
No polio is good.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.206
Internet, so helpful.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.320
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.931
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
<i>Trouble Man</i> soundtrack.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.566
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.728
I'll put it on the list.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.045
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.611
If that's what you want to call running.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.855
That's how it is?

02:53.880 --> 02:55.440
- That's how it is.
- Okay.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.921
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome

02:59.080 --> 03:02.448
in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.250
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.765
Hey, fellas.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.935
Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?

03:11.960 --> 03:13.166
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.601
That's hilarious.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.605
- How you doing?
- Hey.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.415
Can't run everywhere.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.441
No, you can't.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.495
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

03:34.520 --> 03:35.646
the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

03:35.960 --> 03:38.440
They were sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,

03:38.720 --> 03:40.006
93 minutes ago.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.969
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.280
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.970
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.650
I'm sure they have a good reason.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.529
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.563
Relax. It's not that complicated.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.935
How many pirates?

03:54.960 --> 03:57.486
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.762
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.849
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.689
Before the French demobilised him,
he had 36 kill missions.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.695
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.015
Hostages?

04:11.040 --> 04:13.930
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.840
They're in the galley.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.519
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

04:17.680 --> 04:19.523
All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.165
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.206
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

04:24.360 --> 04:26.215
get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.840
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.615
Secure channel seven.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.855
Seven secure.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.405
Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?

04:45.680 --> 04:49.048
Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,

04:49.200 --> 04:50.815
so, no, not really.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.047
<i>Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i>

04:53.240 --> 04:56.244
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.127
That's why I don't ask.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.644
Too shy, or too scared?

05:02.440 --> 05:03.771
Too busy!

05:05.240 --> 05:06.810
Was he wearing a parachute?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.047
No.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.727
No, he wasn't.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.161
Hey!

07:04.040 --> 07:05.041
Don't move.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.241
Thanks.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.482
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.855
What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?

07:18.880 --> 07:20.015
She seems kind of nice.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.815
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.495
I'm multi-tasking.

07:24.840 --> 07:25.887
I told Batroc...

07:26.240 --> 07:27.480
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

07:27.720 --> 07:29.802
...start sending them bodies now!

07:31.680 --> 07:33.728
I have a bullet for someone...

07:34.520 --> 07:36.045
You want a bullet in your head?

07:36.320 --> 07:38.160
Move that foot - you want
a bullet in the head?

07:47.880 --> 07:49.723
I don't like waiting.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.001
Coll Durand.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.375
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.081
Start the engines.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.481
Okay.

08:06.760 --> 08:07.841
Hey, sailor.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.641
Shut up.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.280
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.967
All right, I've waited long enough...

08:44.280 --> 08:45.615
Hey!

08:45.640 --> 08:46.695
Find Batroc...

08:46.720 --> 08:47.721
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

08:47.920 --> 08:49.081
...I start killing them!

08:49.280 --> 08:50.281
I'll find him.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.242
Two minutes.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.007
Radio silence
from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

09:38.360 --> 09:39.407
Targets acquired.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.167
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.400
Natasha, what's your status?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.001
<i>Status, Natasha.</i>

09:47.160 --> 09:48.161
Hang on!

10:04.240 --> 10:05.366
Engine room secure.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.081
Time is up.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.084
Who dies first...?

10:19.520 --> 10:20.521
You!

10:20.640 --> 10:21.641
Get that one.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.201
On my mark.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.011
<i>Three...</i>

10:28.200 --> 10:29.531
<i>Two... One.</i>

10:35.840 --> 10:38.889
I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.005
The line just went dead.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.731
I've lost contact with them...

10:59.280 --> 11:01.408
Hostages en route to extraction.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.726
<i>Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.</i>

11:05.280 --> 11:07.248
<i>Hostiles are still in play.</i>

11:07.400 --> 11:09.767
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.008
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.046
Natasha.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.360
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

12:06.480 --> 12:07.970
Let's see.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.285
Well, this is awkward.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.926
What are you doing?

12:40.080 --> 12:41.375
Backing up the hard drive.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.811
It's a good habit to get into.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.367
Rumlow needed your help.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.800
What the hell are you doing here?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.566
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.011
Whatever I can get my hands on.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.525
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.483
No, that's your mission,

12:57.320 --> 12:58.560
and you've done it beautifully.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.244
You just jeopardised
this whole operation.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.805
I think that's overstating things.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.926
Okay.

13:22.640 --> 13:23.846
That one's on me.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.245
You're damn right.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.215
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.335
I didn't lie.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.725
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.684
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.450
I'm not obliged to do anything.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.080
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.801
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.200
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.924
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.329
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.722
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.008
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.361
I can't lead a mission

14:24.560 --> 14:26.289
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.131
It's called compartmentalisation.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.005
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

14:32.960 --> 14:33.927
Except you.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.165
You're wrong about me.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.240
I do share.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.010
I'm nice like that.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.015
Insight bay.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.160
<i>Captain Rogers does not have</i>

14:48.360 --> 14:49.560
<i>clearance for Project Insight.</i>

14:49.720 --> 14:52.200
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.890
<i>Confirmed.</i>

14:56.480 --> 14:58.323
You know, they used to play music.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.001
Yeah.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.721
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.247
Granddad worked in a nice building.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.646
Got good tips.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.325
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.851
He'd say, "Hi."

15:14.080 --> 15:15.923
People would say, "Hi" back.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.175
Time went on,
the neighbourhood got rougher.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.201
He'd say, "Hi."

15:20.880 --> 15:22.769
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

15:22.960 --> 15:25.200
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.001
Did he ever get mugged?

15:29.120 --> 15:31.964
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

15:32.200 --> 15:33.850
What would he do?

15:34.040 --> 15:35.201
He'd show them.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.242
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.084
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.327
But he didn't trust them very much.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.849
Yeah, I know.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.361
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.121
This is Project Insight.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.482
Three next-generation helicarriers

16:37.720 --> 16:40.371
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.329
Launched from the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

16:42.560 --> 16:45.530
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

16:45.760 --> 16:50.607
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.135
Stark?

16:52.160 --> 16:53.455
He had a few suggestions

16:53.480 --> 16:55.801
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.126
These new long-range precision guns

16:59.280 --> 17:01.726
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.130
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.410
We're gonna neutralise a lot of threats
before they even happen.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.655
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.125
We can't afford to wait that long.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.805
Who's "we"?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.241
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

17:17.440 --> 17:19.727
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

17:20.599 --> 17:22.807
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.483
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.128
You know, I read those SSR files.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.001
"Greatest Generation"?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.410
You guys did some nasty stuff.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.125
Yeah, we compromised.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.560
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.247
But we did it
so that people could be free.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.647
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.202
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.371
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that Programme, Cap.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.203
Don't hold your breath.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.848
<i>Welcome to the Smithsonian.</i>

18:15.000 --> 18:18.527
<i>Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.</i>

18:27.560 --> 18:29.688
<i>A symbol to the nation.</i>

18:30.880 --> 18:32.644
<i>A hero to the world.</i>

18:34.040 --> 18:39.888
<i>The story of Captain America
is one of Honour, bravery and sacrifice.</i>

18:44.560 --> 18:47.325
<i>Denied enlistment due to poor health,</i>

18:47.560 --> 18:49.767
<i>Steven Rogers was chosen
for a Programme</i>

18:49.960 --> 18:53.089
<i>unique in the annals
of American warfare.</i>

18:54.080 --> 18:59.041
<i>One that would transform him
into the world's first Super-Soldier.</i>

19:05.720 --> 19:06.721
<i>In this rare footage,</i>

19:06.880 --> 19:09.247
<i>everyone's favourite war hero,
Captain America...</i>

19:09.400 --> 19:10.925
<i>Battle tested,</i>

19:11.080 --> 19:12.081
<i>Captain America</i>

19:12.440 --> 19:15.569
<i>and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.</i>

19:15.720 --> 19:16.801
<i>Their mission:</i>

19:17.160 --> 19:20.801
<i>taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.</i>

19:24.120 --> 19:26.122
<i>Best friends since childhood,</i>

19:27.080 --> 19:30.402
<i>Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable</i>

19:30.600 --> 19:32.489
<i>on both schoolyard and battlefield.</i>

19:33.880 --> 19:37.930
<i>Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life</i>

19:38.080 --> 19:40.651
<i>in service of his country.</i>

19:45.720 --> 19:47.495
<i>That was a difficult winter.</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:51.002
<i>A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.</i>

19:51.760 --> 19:54.809
<i>Steve, Captain Rogers,</i>

19:55.040 --> 19:57.646
<i>he fought his way
through a HYDRA blockade</i>

19:57.880 --> 20:00.406
<i>that had pinned our allies
down for months.</i>

20:02.360 --> 20:03.805
<i>He saved over 1,000 men.</i>

20:04.800 --> 20:06.370
<i>Including the man who would...</i>

20:07.680 --> 20:10.650
<i>Who would become my husband,
as it turned out.</i>

20:11.520 --> 20:14.285
<i>Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.</i>

20:17.320 --> 20:18.840
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.328
I have lived a life.

20:31.240 --> 20:34.449
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.687
What is it?

20:41.640 --> 20:44.928
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.681
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is any more.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.975
And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.490
Serve.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.722
It's just not the same.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.724
You're always so dramatic.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.567
Look, you saved the world.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.886
We rather mucked it up.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.526
You didn't.

21:20.080 --> 21:23.801
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.687
Hey.

21:28.520 --> 21:32.764
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.122
All we can do is our best.

21:36.320 --> 21:40.564
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.041
Peggy.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.881
Steve.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.767
Yeah?

21:59.440 --> 22:00.726
You're alive.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.485
You came back.

22:04.760 --> 22:05.761
Yeah, Peggy.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.521
It's been so long.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.570
So long.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.126
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.448
Not when she owes me a dance.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.805
Secure office.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.610
Open <i>Lemurian Star's</i>
satellite launch file.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.369
<i>Access denied.</i>

22:43.080 --> 22:44.081
Run decryption.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.603
<i>Decryption failed.</i>

22:48.800 --> 22:51.485
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.569
<i>Override denied. All files sealed.</i>

22:56.760 --> 22:58.205
On whose authority?

22:58.400 --> 23:00.641
<i>Fury, Nicholas J.</i>

23:06.200 --> 23:07.326
World Security Council.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.686
<i>Confirmed.</i>

23:11.320 --> 23:13.640
<i>If Nick Fury thinks
he can get his costumed thugs</i>

23:13.800 --> 23:17.043
<i>and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to
mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.</i>

23:17.240 --> 23:18.401
This failure is unacceptable.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.204
Considering this attack took place

23:20.400 --> 23:22.164
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

23:22.320 --> 23:24.721
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.849
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.128
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.289
A breach like this
raises serious questions.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.164
Like how the hell did a French pirate

23:33.360 --> 23:37.251
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

23:37.440 --> 23:39.522
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.162
I can draw a map if it'd help.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.164
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.924
But this Council takes things
like international piracy fairly seriously.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.369
Really? I don't.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.371
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.335
If this Council is going to fall to rancour

24:00.360 --> 24:03.045
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

24:04.280 --> 24:06.328
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.046
Mr Secretary,
nobody is suggesting...

24:13.120 --> 24:14.215
Excuse me.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.844
More trouble, Mr Secretary?

24:16.040 --> 24:17.644
Depends on your definition.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.483
I work 40 floors away
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

24:29.680 --> 24:31.762
A nuclear war would do it, too.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.206
You busy in there?

24:34.400 --> 24:35.890
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.202
I'm here to ask a favour.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.843
I want you to call for a vote.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.162
Project Insight has to be delayed.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.722
Nick, that's not a favour,

24:48.960 --> 24:50.450
that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.360
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.131
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.367
But if it's something?

24:56.560 --> 24:59.370
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.442
Fine.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.727
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.531
Thank you, sir.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.610
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.441
<i>The thing is,</i>

25:16.040 --> 25:18.008
I think it's getting worse.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.567
A cop pulled me over last week.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.046
He thought I was drunk.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.682
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.929
I thought it was an IED.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.089
Some stuff you leave there.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.448
Other stuff you bring back.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.530
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

25:40.760 --> 25:44.924
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

25:46.080 --> 25:47.127
It's up to you.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.840
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.007
Look who it is, the running man.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.326
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.490
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.406
Guilt,

26:02.840 --> 26:04.080
regret.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.210
You lose someone?

26:06.840 --> 26:09.241
My wingman, Riley.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.321
Flying a night mission.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.847
Standard PJ rescue Op.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.088
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

26:16.280 --> 26:19.887
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.331
Nothing I could do.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.922
It's like I was up there just to watch.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.008
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

26:29.160 --> 26:32.801
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?

26:34.760 --> 26:37.001
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

26:37.840 --> 26:41.481
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.681
So, hell yeah.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.200
Are you thinking about getting out?

26:45.840 --> 26:46.841
No.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.041
I don't know.

26:51.560 --> 26:54.131
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.

26:54.640 --> 26:55.840
Ultimate fighting?

26:56.480 --> 26:58.881
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.441
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.487
What makes you happy?

27:05.400 --> 27:07.084
I don't know.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.325
<i>Activating

27:11.560 --> 27:13.847
Open secure line 0405.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.367
<i>Confirmed.</i>

27:16.720 --> 27:17.767
<i>This is Hill.</i>

27:17.920 --> 27:19.763
I need you here in D.C.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.691
Deep shadow conditions.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.575
<i>Give me four hours.</i>

27:24.600 --> 27:26.204
You have three. Over.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.124
Want to see my lease?

28:02.040 --> 28:03.280
<i>Fracture detected.</i>

28:06.440 --> 28:08.807
<i>Recommend anaesthetic injection.</i>

28:13.560 --> 28:16.882
<i>D.C. Metro Police dispatch

28:22.160 --> 28:23.207
Get me out of here.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.200
<i>Propulsion systems offline.</i>

28:27.320 --> 28:28.321
Then reboot, damn it!

28:49.080 --> 28:50.730
<i>Warning. Window

28:50.840 --> 28:52.410
You think?

28:55.840 --> 28:56.935

29:15.360 --> 29:17.295
<i>Window integrity 1%.</i>

29:17.320 --> 29:18.481

29:28.880 --> 29:30.530
<i>Propulsion systems now online.</i>

30:23.040 --> 30:24.087

So sweet. That is so nice.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.447
Hi.

33:42.680 --> 33:43.841
I got to go, though.

33:44.640 --> 33:45.846
Okay. Bye.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.644
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.401
Yeah.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.087
Hey, if you want...

33:54.280 --> 33:56.442
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.480
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.531
Yeah? What's it cost?

34:01.480 --> 34:03.209
A cup of coffee?

34:06.240 --> 34:07.651
Thank you, but

34:08.199 --> 34:09.884
I already have a load in downstairs,

34:10.080 --> 34:12.924
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

34:13.120 --> 34:16.123
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...

34:16.360 --> 34:18.328
Well, I'll keep my distance.

34:18.520 --> 34:19.646
Hopefully, not too far.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.360
And I think you left your stereo on.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.290
Right. Thank you.

34:27.480 --> 34:28.481
Yeah.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.044
I don't remember giving you a key.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.042
You really think I'd need one?

35:22.040 --> 35:23.690
My wife kicked me out.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.526
I didn't know you were married.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.202
A lot of things you don't know about me.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.883
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.042
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.691
Who else knows about your wife?

36:02.400 --> 36:03.526
Just...

36:06.120 --> 36:07.884
My friends.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.650
Is that what we are?

36:10.320 --> 36:11.731
That's up to you.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.682
Don't trust anyone.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.767
Captain Rogers?

36:39.840 --> 36:40.841
Captain,

36:41.120 --> 36:43.122
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Special Service.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.447
Kate?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.200
I'm assigned to protect you.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.566
On whose order?

36:49.800 --> 36:50.801
His.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.565
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

36:57.760 --> 36:58.761
I need EMTs.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.680
<i>Do we have a 20 on the shooter?</i>

37:01.160 --> 37:02.491
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.175
Is he gonna make it?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.645
I don't know.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.725
Tell me about the shooter.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.048
He's fast. Strong.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.240
Had a metal arm.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.840
Ballistics?

38:22.480 --> 38:25.927
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.406
Soviet-made.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.401
Yeah.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.615
He's in V-tach.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.695
Crash cart coming in.

38:32.720 --> 38:33.735
Nurse, help me with the drape.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.680
- BP's dropping.
- Defibrillator!

38:37.720 --> 38:39.165
I want you to charge him at 100.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.725
Don't do this to me, Nick.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.200
Stand back.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.566
Three, two,

38:43.920 --> 38:45.490
one. Clear.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.575
- Pulse?
- No pulse.

38:48.600 --> 38:49.761
Okay, 200, please.

38:49.880 --> 38:50.961
Stand back!

38:51.160 --> 38:53.401
Three, two, one. Clear!

38:53.560 --> 38:54.607
Get me epinephrine!

38:55.880 --> 38:56.895
Pulse?

38:56.920 --> 38:57.921
Negative.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.608
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

39:22.760 --> 39:23.975
What's the time?

39:24.000 --> 39:25.081
1:03, Doctor.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.965
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.044
I need to take him.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.081
Natasha.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.967
Natasha!

40:40.640 --> 40:41.880
Why was Fury in your apartment?

40:43.720 --> 40:45.051
I don't know.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.800
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.367
Yeah, give me a second.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.481
They want you now.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.171
Okay.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.402
You're a terrible liar.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.130
<i>S.T.R.I.K.E.
team, escort Captain Rogers</i>

41:05.400 --> 41:07.721
<i>back to S. H. I.E. L.D.
immediately for questioning.</i>

41:07.880 --> 41:09.370
I told him.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.845
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.681
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.567
Captain Rogers.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.080
Neighbour.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.844
Captain.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.281
I'm Alexander Pierce.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.331
Sir, it's an Honour.

41:46.560 --> 41:47.640
The honour's mine, Captain.

41:47.800 --> 41:50.246
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.040
That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

41:54.280 --> 41:56.647
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.320
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

41:59.520 --> 42:03.764
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

42:04.240 --> 42:07.449
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

42:07.600 --> 42:08.931
and he comes to me with a plan.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.135
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.925
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

42:14.960 --> 42:18.487
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

42:18.720 --> 42:20.848
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

42:21.040 --> 42:22.451
They find it empty.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.563
Nick had ignored my direct order,

42:25.760 --> 42:29.082
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

42:29.800 --> 42:31.882
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,

42:32.200 --> 42:33.326
including my daughter.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.050
So you gave him a promotion.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.805
I've never had any cause to regret it.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.122
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

42:45.200 --> 42:46.281
I don't know.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.851
Did you know it was bugged?

42:49.760 --> 42:52.081
I did, because Nick told me.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.040
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?

43:01.800 --> 43:03.006
I want you to see something.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.400
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

43:05.520 --> 43:06.442
Is that live?

43:06.840 --> 43:10.208
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.855
Are you saying he's a suspect?

43:12.880 --> 43:14.530
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.526
No, no.
It's more complicated than that.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.286
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

43:20.480 --> 43:23.962
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

43:24.680 --> 43:28.571
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.043
The last one going to
a holding company

43:31.200 --> 43:33.407
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

43:33.600 --> 43:34.960
Am I supposed to know who that is?

43:35.120 --> 43:37.122
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.251
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.288
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

43:45.960 --> 43:49.248
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

43:49.760 --> 43:51.444
The prevailing theory

43:52.520 --> 43:55.330
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

43:55.520 --> 43:57.887
and sale of classified intelligence.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.530
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.445
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

44:09.680 --> 44:11.762
Why do you think we're talking?

44:15.400 --> 44:17.971
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

44:18.160 --> 44:21.926
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

44:23.400 --> 44:27.724
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

44:28.560 --> 44:30.927
to build a really better world

44:31.640 --> 44:34.803
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.485
And that makes enemies.

44:40.760 --> 44:43.650
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

44:43.840 --> 44:46.605
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.685
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

44:52.160 --> 44:54.606
makes me really, really angry.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.935
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.962
I don't think that's an accident.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.124
And I don't think you do, either.

45:07.360 --> 45:09.169
So, I'm gonna ask again.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.369
Why was he there?

45:14.280 --> 45:16.601
He told me not to trust anyone.

45:18.840 --> 45:21.047
I wonder if that included him.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.166
I'm sorry.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.606
Those were his last words.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.446
Excuse me.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.325
Captain,

45:36.520 --> 45:39.524
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.006
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

45:44.360 --> 45:45.771
Anyone.

45:48.680 --> 45:50.125
Understood.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.051
Operations Control.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.645
<i>Confirmed.</i>

46:12.000 --> 46:14.335
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site.

46:14.360 --> 46:15.691
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.120
- Forensics.
<i>- Confirmed.</i>

46:17.320 --> 46:18.481
Cap.

46:18.880 --> 46:19.881
Rumlow.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.205
Evidence Response found some fibres
on the roof they want us to see.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.964
You want me to get the Tac team ready?

46:34.160 --> 46:35.760
No, let's wait and see what it is first.

46:35.880 --> 46:36.961
Right.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.529
What's the status so far?

46:51.720 --> 46:53.600
- Administrations level.
<i>- Confirmed.</i>

46:53.920 --> 46:55.365
Excuse me.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.887
I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.048
It's messed up, what happened to him.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.571
Thank you.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.567
Records.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.886
Confirmed.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.563
Before we get started,

47:49.280 --> 47:51.282
does anyone want to get out?

48:25.440 --> 48:27.204
Mobilise S.T.R.I.K.E. units, 25th floor.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.845
Whoa, big guy.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.645
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!

48:59.400 --> 49:00.526
It kind of feels personal.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.522
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!

49:28.240 --> 49:30.720
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

49:31.120 --> 49:32.565
You have nowhere to go!

49:52.400 --> 49:53.535
Are you kidding me?

49:53.560 --> 49:55.722
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.

50:07.200 --> 50:10.283
<i>Stand down, Captain Rogers.
Stand down.</i>

50:10.760 --> 50:12.922
<i>Repeat, stand down.</i>

50:49.480 --> 50:50.970
Eyes here.

50:51.400 --> 50:53.243
Whatever your Op is, bury it.

50:53.480 --> 50:54.481
This is Level One.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.729
Contact DOT.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.600
All traffic lights in the district go red.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.122
Shut all runways at BWI,

51:01.480 --> 51:03.164
IAD and Reagan.

51:03.360 --> 51:06.040
All security cameras in the city
go through this monitor right here.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.281
Scan all open sources,

51:08.840 --> 51:10.205
phones, computers,

51:10.520 --> 51:11.806
PDAs. Whatever.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.015
If someone tweets about this guy,

51:14.040 --> 51:15.087
I want to know about it.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.325
With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

51:17.560 --> 51:20.291
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.205
Because he lied to us.

51:23.840 --> 51:27.322
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.484
He refused to share it.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.648
As difficult as this is to accept,

51:33.720 --> 51:37.008
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

52:04.600 --> 52:05.647
- Where is it?
- Safe.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.404
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

52:07.640 --> 52:08.880
Why would I tell you?

52:09.080 --> 52:11.128
Fury gave it to you. Why?

52:11.320 --> 52:12.731
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

52:12.920 --> 52:13.921
Stop lying.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.760
I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.

52:17.040 --> 52:19.000
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

52:20.040 --> 52:22.964
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.406
I'm not gonna ask you again.

52:26.280 --> 52:27.486
I know who killed Fury.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.920
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.964
The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.

52:37.160 --> 52:39.162
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

52:39.360 --> 52:41.249
in the last 50 years.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.245
So he's a ghost story.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.683
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

52:46.880 --> 52:49.167
Somebody shot out
my tyres near Odessa.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.647
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

52:51.840 --> 52:53.126
I pulled us out.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.209
But the Winter Soldier was there.

52:55.960 --> 52:58.247
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him

52:58.600 --> 52:59.601
straight through me.

53:00.440 --> 53:01.521
Soviet slug.

53:02.120 --> 53:04.726
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

53:06.240 --> 53:08.129
Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.

53:10.840 --> 53:13.366
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.768
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

53:21.640 --> 53:23.529
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.888
<i>Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.</i>

53:26.360 --> 53:27.855
To any reasonable person,

53:27.880 --> 53:30.486
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.

53:30.600 --> 53:31.965
You know what makes him a traitor?

53:32.120 --> 53:34.487
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

53:34.640 --> 53:36.961
Nick Fury used your friendship

53:37.120 --> 53:40.169
to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.681
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.890
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

53:46.080 --> 53:48.401
Are you calling for my resignation?

53:48.600 --> 53:50.040
I've got a pen and paper right here.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.726
That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.490
But you do want to have a discussion?

53:55.640 --> 53:57.563
We've already had it, Mr Secretary.

53:58.640 --> 54:03.043
This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.

54:04.320 --> 54:07.688
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

54:13.800 --> 54:17.088
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.161
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.815
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

54:25.840 --> 54:27.775
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

54:27.800 --> 54:28.880
How much time will we have?

54:29.320 --> 54:31.527
About nine minutes from

54:33.160 --> 54:34.207
now.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.170
Fury was right about that ship.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.442
Somebody's trying to hide something.

54:43.640 --> 54:45.608
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

54:45.840 --> 54:48.207
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.050
Can you override it?

54:50.800 --> 54:53.081
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

54:53.400 --> 54:54.561
Slightly.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.640
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.495
This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

55:09.520 --> 55:10.885
to track hostile malware,

55:11.040 --> 55:13.850
so if we can't read the file,

55:14.080 --> 55:15.680
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

55:16.240 --> 55:17.600
Can I help you guys with anything?

55:18.040 --> 55:21.601
No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.723
Right. We're getting married.

55:23.960 --> 55:26.200
Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?

55:27.760 --> 55:29.250
New Jersey.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.850
I have the exact same glasses.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.410
Wow, you two are practically twins.

55:38.680 --> 55:40.091
Yeah, I wish.

55:40.600 --> 55:41.601
Specimen.

55:42.280 --> 55:44.415
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.441
Thank you.

55:47.920 --> 55:50.287
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

55:51.520 --> 55:52.601
Got it.

55:56.760 --> 55:57.895
You know it?

55:57.920 --> 55:59.490
I used to. Let's go.

56:01.640 --> 56:02.880
Standard Tac team.

56:03.080 --> 56:04.411
Two behind, two across,

56:04.600 --> 56:06.204
and two coming straight at us.

56:06.400 --> 56:09.255
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.248
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

56:11.440 --> 56:12.680
- What?
- Do it.

56:20.960 --> 56:21.961
Negative at the source.

56:22.120 --> 56:23.121
Give me a floor rundown.

56:23.640 --> 56:24.880
<i>Negative on three.</i>

56:25.200 --> 56:26.360
<i>Negative on two.</i>

56:26.560 --> 56:28.801
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

56:36.840 --> 56:37.807
- Kiss me.
- What?

56:38.040 --> 56:40.042
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

56:40.240 --> 56:41.366
Yes, they do.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.410
You still uncomfortable?

56:53.320 --> 56:54.845
It's not exactly the word I would use.

57:03.960 --> 57:06.088
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

57:07.040 --> 57:08.610
Nazi Germany.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.048
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

57:15.320 --> 57:18.847
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

57:19.080 --> 57:20.495
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

57:20.520 --> 57:21.851
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

57:22.080 --> 57:24.560
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

57:25.080 --> 57:26.525
- That bad?
- I didn't say that.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.284
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

57:28.400 --> 57:29.535
No, I didn't.

57:29.560 --> 57:31.483
I just wondered
how much practice you've had.

57:31.680 --> 57:33.330
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

57:33.520 --> 57:35.761
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.889
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

57:38.440 --> 57:40.015
Nobody special, though?

57:42.200 --> 57:43.335
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

57:43.360 --> 57:45.735
to find someone with
shared life experience.

57:45.760 --> 57:47.775
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.723
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

57:49.920 --> 57:51.046
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

57:51.200 --> 57:53.567
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.

57:54.880 --> 57:55.881
Neither am I.

57:56.640 --> 57:57.880
That's a tough way to live.

57:59.120 --> 58:01.202
It's a good way not to die, though.

58:02.080 --> 58:03.525
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,

58:03.720 --> 58:05.560
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

58:06.280 --> 58:07.361
Yeah.

58:10.560 --> 58:11.641
Who do you want me to be?

58:12.600 --> 58:13.601
How about a friend?

58:17.080 --> 58:21.165
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.331
This is it.

58:39.560 --> 58:41.483
The file came from these coordinates.

58:42.760 --> 58:43.966
So did I.

58:52.160 --> 58:53.605
This camp is where I was trained.

58:56.640 --> 58:57.801
Change much?

59:00.440 --> 59:01.680
A little.

59:01.880 --> 59:04.008
Pick up the pace, ladies!

59:04.200 --> 59:05.804
Let's go! Let's go!

59:06.640 --> 59:07.880
Double time!

59:09.160 --> 59:11.162
Come on, Rogers, move it!

59:15.200 --> 59:16.531
Come on, fall in!

59:17.560 --> 59:18.641
Rogers!

59:19.080 --> 59:20.320
I said fall in!

59:22.640 --> 59:23.801
This is a dead end.

59:23.960 --> 59:26.770
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

59:28.200 --> 59:31.044
Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.001
What is it?

59:34.200 --> 59:36.175
Army regulations
forbid storing munitions

59:36.200 --> 59:38.123
within 500 yards of the barracks.

59:38.920 --> 59:40.968
This building is in the wrong place.

59:56.360 --> 59:58.169
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.963
Maybe where it started.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.769
And there's Stark's father.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.725
Howard.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.280
Who's the girl?

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.001
If you're already working
in a secret office,

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.215
why do you need to hide the elevator?

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.646
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.602
Y-E-S spells yes.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.603
Shall we play a game?

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.601
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.808
<i>Rogers, Steven,</i>

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.524
<i>born 1918.</i>

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.411
<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,</i>

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.443
<i>born 1984.</i>

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.005
It's some kind of recording.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.521
<i>I am not a recording, Fräulein.</i>

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.929
<i>I may not be the man I was</i>

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.363
<i>when the Captain took me
prisoner in 1945.</i>

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.484
<i>But I am.</i>

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.765
You know this thing?

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.164
Arnim Zola was a German
scientist who worked for the Red Skull.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.607
He's been dead for years.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.087
<i>First correction, I am Swiss.</i>

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.887
<i>Second, look around you.</i>

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.691
<i>I have never been more alive.</i>

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.524
<i>In 1972,
I received a terminal diagnosis.</i>

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.485
<i>Science could not save my body.</i>

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.890
<i>My mind, however,
that was worth saving,</i>

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.886
<i>on 200,000 feet of databanks.</i>

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.641
<i>You are standing in my brain.</i>

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.087
- How did you get here?
<i>- Invited.</i>

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.927
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.761
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited
German scientists with strategic value.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.082
<i>They thought I could help their cause.</i>

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.129
<i>I also helped my own.</i>

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.845
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.931
<i>Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.</i>

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.771
Prove it.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.043
<i>Accessing archive.</i>

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.922
<i>HYDRA was founded on
the belief that humanity</i>

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.283
<i>could not be trusted
with its own freedom.</i>

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.165
<i>What we did not realise was
that if you try</i>

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.170
<i>to take that freedom, they resist.</i>

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.565
<i>The war taught us much.</i>

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.448
<i>Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.</i>

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.331
<i>After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,</i>

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.648
<i>and I was recruited.</i>

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.082
<i>The new HYDRA grew.</i>

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.569
<i>A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.644
<i>For 70 years,</i>

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:50.443
<i>HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,</i>

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.325
<i>and when history did not cooperate,</i>

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.810
<i>history was changed.</i>

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.322
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.841
<i>Accidents will happen.</i>

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.650
<i>HYDRA created a world so chaotic</i>

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.680
<i>that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom</i>

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.042
<i>to gain its security.</i>

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.083
<i>Once a purification process
is complete,</i>

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.008
<i>HYDRA'S new world order will arise.</i>

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.843
<i>We won, Captain.</i>

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.527
<i>Your death amounts to
the same as your life.</i>

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.047
<i>A zero sum.</i>

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.569
<i>As I was saying...</i>

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.447
What's on this drive?

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.923
<i>Project Insight requires insight.</i>

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.926
<i>So, I wrote an algorithm.</i>

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.655
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.206
<i>The answer to your question
is fascinating.</i>

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.690
<i>Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.</i>

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.965
Steve, we got a bogey.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.970
Short range ballistic.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.015
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.041
S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.966
<i>I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.</i>

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.561
<i>Admit it.</i>

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.961
<i>It's better this way.</i>

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.571
<i>We are, both of us,</i>

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.120
<i>out of time.</i>

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.085
Call in the asset.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.720
I'm going to go, Mr Pierce.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.049
You need anything before I leave?

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.128
No... It's fine, Renata,
you can go home.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.444
Okay. Night-night.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.330
Good night.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.845
Want some milk?

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:26.323
The timetable has moved.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.209
Our window is limited.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.368
Two targets, Level Six.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.046
They already cost me Zola.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.447
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:46.528
Sorry, Mr Pierce, I...

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.326
I forgot my

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.685
phone.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.849
Renata,
I wish you would have knocked.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.535
Hey, man.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.087
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:28.930
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.370
Not everyone.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.044
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.450
What's going on?

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.122
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.884
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.842
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.405
but I guess I can't tell
the difference any more.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.480
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.721
I owe you.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.327
It's okay.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.087
If it was the other way around,

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.975
and it was down to me to save your life,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.490
now you be honest with me,

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.569
would you trust me to do it?

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.721
I would now.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.524
And I'm always honest.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.000
Well, you seem pretty chipper

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.240
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.446
Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.321
I made breakfast.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.884
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.845
So, the question is,

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.360
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.121
Pierce.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.051
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.361
But he's not working alone.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.881
Zola's algorithm
was on the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.530
So was Jasper Sitwell.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.521
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.644
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.369
The answer is, you don't.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.049
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.290
Is this Bakhmala?

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.080
The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.051
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.928
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.640
I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:05.855
What did you use? A stealth chute?

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.927
No.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.085
These.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.440
I thought you said you were a pilot.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.931
I never said pilot.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.684
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.725
You got out for a good reason.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.445
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.240
There's no better reason to get back in.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.604
Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.000
The last one is at Fort Meade.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.486
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.646
Shouldn't be a problem.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.964
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.970
because I got
some constituency problem

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.043
and I got to press the flesh.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.527
Any constituent in particular,
Mr Senator?

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.491
No, not really.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.329
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.126
Real hot, you know?

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.482
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.720
Who listens at that point?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.560
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.802
Really? Because she's killing my back.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.524
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.767
This is a nice pin.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.168
- Thank you.
- Come here.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.325
Hail HYDRA.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.480
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.120
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.681
I need a minute.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.530
Bring the car around.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.375
Yes, sir?

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.084
<i>Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?</i>

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.886
<i>I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.</i>

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.047
Who is this?

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.885
<i>The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.</i>

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.126
<i>Your other 10 o'clock.</i>

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.001
<i>There you go.</i>

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.365
What do you want?

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.440
<i>You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.</i>

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.086
There's a grey car two spaces down.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.123
You and I are gonna take a ride.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.049
And why would I do that?

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.806
Because that tie looks really expensive,

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.208
<i>and I'd hate to mess it up.</i>

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.040
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.175
Never heard of it.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.295
What were you doing
on the <i>Lemurian Star?</i>

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.049
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.480
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.240
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.241
You're right.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.167
It's not.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.681
It's hers.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.206
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.615
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.895
Yeah, she's cute.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.410
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.362
Zola's algorithm is a program

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.121
for choosing

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.885
- insight's targets.
- What targets?

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.361
You!

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.727
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defence,

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.366
a high school Valedictorian in Iowa City,

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.640
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.524
to HYDRA.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.449
Now, or in the future.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.524
In the future? How could it know?

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.167
How could it not?

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.648
The 21st century is a digital book.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.803
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.846
Your bank records,

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.691
medical histories, voting patterns,

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.326
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.208
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.320
to predict their future.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.687
And what then?

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.884
My God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.525
What then?

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.203
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.283
A few million at a time.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.001
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.920
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.326
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.567
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.683
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.320
and access the helicarriers directly.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:37.527
What? Are you crazy?

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.160
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.006
Shit!

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.765
Hang on!

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.130
I have her. Find him.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.401
Go! I got this!

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.124
<i>Taking fire above
and below expressway.</i>

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.760
<i>Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.</i>

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.651
<i>I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.</i>

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.881
<i>Rendezvous, two minutes.</i>

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.321
Get out of the way!

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.484
Stay out of the way!

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.607
Bucky?

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.605
Who the hell is Bucky?

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.840
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.450
Get on your knees!

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.255
Get down, get down! Get on your knees!

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.441
Down!

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.961
Don't move.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.246
Put the gun down.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.363
Not here. Not here!

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.927
<i>It was him.</i>

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.687
He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.931
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.326
Zola.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.124
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.169
Zola experimented on him.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.687
Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.735
They must have found him and...

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.683
None of that's your fault, Steve.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.049
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.089
We need to get a doctor here.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.281
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.080
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.523
That thing was squeezing my brain.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.681
Who is this guy?

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.448
Three holes. Start digging.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.523
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.926
Maybe two.

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.082
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.241
About damn time.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.804
Lacerated spinal column,

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.815
cracked sternum,

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.444
shattered collarbone,

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.284
perforated liver,

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.204
and one hell of a headache.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.805
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.286
Let's not forget that.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.130
Otherwise, I'm good.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.642
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.888
Tetrodotoxin B.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.048
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.049
Banner developed it for stress.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.846
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.929
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.407
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.087
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.521
Besides,

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.325
I wasn't sure who to trust.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.171
Sergeant Barnes.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.321
Bucky, no!

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:37.123
<i>The procedure has already started.</i>

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.686
<i>You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.</i>

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.081
<i>Put him on ice.</i>

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.481
Sir.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.690
He's unstable.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.611
Erratic.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.961
Mission report.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.811
Mission report now.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.011
The man on the bridge.

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.400
Who was he?

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.087
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.491
I knew him.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.765
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.451
You shaped the century.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.600
And I need you to do it one more time.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.566
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.445
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.769
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:23.284
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.924
But I knew him.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:35.965
Prep him.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.766
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.962
Then wipe him and start over.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:26.241
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.243
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.802
it was a responsibility.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.043
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.040
We have to stop the launch.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.765
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls any more.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.361
What's that?

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.455
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:52.848
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponised.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.204
We need to breach those carriers

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.015
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.041
One or two won't cut it.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.766
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:05.282
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.284
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.683
We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.082
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.403
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.760
We're not salvaging anything.

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.040
We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.375
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.686
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.087
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.320
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.249
HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.563
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.604
How many paid the price
before you did?

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.404
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.480
Even if you had,
would you have told me?

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.405
Or would you have
compartmentalised that, too?

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:46.405
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:47.926
it all goes.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.646
He's right.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.487
Don't look at me.

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.569
I do what he does, just slower.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.930
Well...

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.601
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.775
<i>We looked for you, after.</i>

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.002
<i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i>

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.807
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:35.331
How was it?

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.290
It was okay.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.643
She's next to Dad.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.406
I was gonna ask...

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.560
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.080
We can put the
couch cushions on the floor

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.650
like when we were kids.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.800
It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.924
maybe take out the trash.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:00.371
Come on.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:06.847
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:11.406
The thing is, you don't have to.

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.400
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.055
He's gonna be there, you know.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.127
I know.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.368
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.207
I don't think he's the kind you save.

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.845
He's the kind you stop.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.124
I don't know if I can do that.

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.408
Well, he might not give you a choice.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.090
He doesn't know you.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.847
He will.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.886
Gear up. It's time.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.646
You gonna wear that?

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.248
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.605
Man.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.482
I am so fired.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.601
<i>We are in final launch sequence.</i>

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:35.163
We are go on guidance.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.208
<i>All personnel to launch stations.</i>

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.240
And how was your flight?

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.455
Lovely.

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.960
The ride from the airport, less so.

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.606
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:49.683
Including Captain America.

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.691
This facility is biometrically controlled.

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.770
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.926
I've been parking there for two months.

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.760
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:07.215
I think Afghanistan.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.242
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.815
Well, he could've said something.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.731
Must be the dish.

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.124
I'll check it out.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.964
<i>Triskelion command
request we clear the area for launch.</i>

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.655
Excuse us.

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.126
<i>I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,</i>

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.962
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:35.207
Finally, we're here.

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.843
And the world should be grateful.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.529
<i>Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,</i>

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:42.484
<i>this is Steve Rogers.</i>

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.487
<i>You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.</i>

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.807
<i>Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.</i>

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.370
But I think it's time you know the truth.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.682
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.609
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.404
<i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i>

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:09.841
<i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.</i>

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.120
<i>I don't know how many more,</i>

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.800
but I know they're in the building.

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.089
<i>They could be standing
right next to you.</i>

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.324
<i>They almost have what they want.</i>

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.202
<i>Absolute control.</i>

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:25.045
They shot Nick Fury.

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.286
<i>And it won't end there.</i>

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.047
If you launch those helicarriers today,

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.520
<i>HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.</i>

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:36.891
<i>Unless we stop them.</i>

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.006
<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.083
<i>But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.</i>

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.729
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.890
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.324
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.368
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.484
You smug son of a bitch.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.641
Arrest him.

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.130
I guess I've got the floor.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.924
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.855
Is there a problem?

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.881
Um...

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.921
Is there a problem?

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.201
I'm sorry, sir.

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.127
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.126
Captain's orders.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.606
Move away from your station.

01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.007
Like he said...

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.255
Hold it right there.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.645
Put the gun down!

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.801
Captain's orders.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.645
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.084
Depends on where you're standing.

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.040
Close the bay door!

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.360
Close the bay door now!

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.807
Close the bay door!

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.886
They're initiating launch.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.686
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.480
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:18.721
Hey, Cap,

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.975
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.001
You okay?

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.685
I'm not dead yet.

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.404
Let me ask you a question.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.049
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.520
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:46.445
into a soccer stadium for execution,

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.202
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.601
Wouldn't you?

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:55.450
Wouldn't you all?

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.810
Not if it was your switch.

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.526
I'm sorry.

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.530
Did I step on your moment?

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.367
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.481
Falcon, status?

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:39.881
Engaging.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.286
All right, Cap. I'm in.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:08.727
Shit.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:40.685
<i>Eight minutes, Cap.</i>

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:42.565
Working on it.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.015
What are you doing?

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.695
She's disabling security protocols

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:55.520
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:57.360
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:42:59.681
If you do this,

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.604
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.206
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.925
as you really are?

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.125
Are you?

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.407
Alpha lock.

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:31.851
Falcon, where are you now?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:32.922
I had to take a detour.

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:04.841
Whoo!

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.124
Yeah!

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.167
I'm in.

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.643
Bravo lock.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.726
Two down, one to go.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.840
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:30.006
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:15.165
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.010
It takes two Alpha Level members.

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.255
Don't worry. Company's coming.

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.926
Did you get my flowers?

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.480
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.123
Because I thought you had me killed.

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.805
You know how the game works.

01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.655
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:57.966
Because you were the best,

01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.720
and the most ruthless person
I ever met.

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:02.161
I did what I did to protect people.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.048
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.281
Disorder. War.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.601
It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.962
or an EMP fries Chicago.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.965
Diplomacy?

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.441
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:23.284
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.771
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:33.284
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.610
by sacrificing 20 million.

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.128
It's the next step, Nick.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.446
If you have the courage to take it.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.722
No. I have the courage not to.

01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:49.175
<i>Retinal scanner active.</i>

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.001
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:55.128
I know you erased my password.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.243
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:00.644
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr Secretary,

01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:07.610
you need to keep both eyes open.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.525
<i>Alpha level confirmed.</i>

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.843
<i>Encryption code accepted.</i>

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.206
<i>Safeguards removed.</i>

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.564
Charlie carrier is
45 degrees off the port bow.

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.361
Six minutes.

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:30.000
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.530
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.366
I just did!

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.043
You know, you're a lot heavier
than you look.

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:57.366
I had a big breakfast.

01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.291
Steve!

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:33.320
<i>Cap! Cap, come in.
Are you okay?</i>

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.006
Yeah, I'm here.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:36.720
I'm still on the helicarrier.

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.290
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm grounded.</i>

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.247
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.929
Don't worry. I got it.

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.615
<i>Emergency evacuation alert.</i>

01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:51.610
<i>All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.</i>

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.280
All S.H.I.E.L.D.
agents regroup at Rally Point Delta.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.928
<i>Sir, the Council's been breached.</i>

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.641
- Repeat, Dispatch.
<i>- Black Widow's up there.</i>

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:07.171
Headed up.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:10.646
- Falcon?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:11.775
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:12.801
I'm on it.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:25.480
People are gonna die, Buck.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.050
I can't let that happen.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.845
Please don't make me do this.

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.087
Done.

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.081
And it's trending.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.615
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:02.766
I'd put that gun down.

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.408
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:42.321
Drop it!

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:43.961
Drop it!

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:07.723
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:16.044
This is gonna hurt.

01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:20.403
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.841
And order only comes through pain.

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.607
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:29.815
Lieutenant, how much longer?

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:31.975
<i>65 seconds to satellite link.</i>

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.004
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.081
One minute.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.525
<i>30 seconds, Cap.</i>

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.685
Stand by.

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.010
Charlie...

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:20.575
<i>We've reached 3,000 feet.</i>

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.680
Sat link coming online now.

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:25.201
Deploy algorithm.

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:28.520
Algorithm deployed.

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.800
<i>We are go to target.</i>

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:51.165
<i>Target saturation reached.</i>

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.615
All targets assigned.

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:53.687
Fire when ready.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.366
Firing in...

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.601
<i>Three,</i>

01:53:58.880 --> 01:53:59.935
two...

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.411
One.

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:06.127
Charlie lock.

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.601
Where are the targets?

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:10.081
Where are the targets?

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:11.926
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:30.361
Fire now.

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:32.680
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:34.601
<i>Do it now!</i>

01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:06.161
What a waste.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:09.529
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.803
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way.
Come on.

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.805
You're going to fly me out of here.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.163
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:19.691
You already did.

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:21.808
You will again, when it's useful.

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.281
Romanoff.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.081
Natasha.

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.924
Natasha! Come on!

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.525
Those really do sting.

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:24.971
Hail HYDRA.

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:21.930
You're out of your depth, kid.

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.130
Son of a bitch!

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.120
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.200
<i>Sam, where are you?</i>

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.483
41st floor! Northwest corner!

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:47.250
We're on it! Stay where you are!

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.521
Not an option!

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:05.482
41st floor! 41st!

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:09.162
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:13.040
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.601
You know me.

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:33.691
No, I don't!

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:44.531
Bucky.

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:47.485
You've known me your whole life.

01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:58.965
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:00.400
Shut up!

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:10.565
I'm not gonna fight you.

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:15.891
You're my friend.

01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:24.285
You're my mission.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:28.562
You're my mission!

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:32.921
Then finish it.

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.607
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:51.611
On your left.

02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:45.001
<i>Do you solemnly
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,</i>

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.281
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:47.925
<i>I do.</i>

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:51.680
<i>Why haven't
we yet heard from Captain Rogers?</i>

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.243
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.

02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:58.283
I think the wreck in
the middle of the Potomac

02:02:58.480 --> 02:02:59.855
made his point fairly eloquently.

02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:00.920
Well, he could explain how

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.646
this country is expected to maintain
its national security

02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.930
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:10.322
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.370
Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.

02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:14.800
Agent, you should know

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.644
that there are some on this committee

02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:18.968
who feel, given your service record,

02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:20.889
both for this country and against it,

02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:23.404
that you belong in a penitentiary.

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.568
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:29.084
You're not going to put me in a prison.

02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:34.005
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:36.851
Do enlighten us.

02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:38.451
Because you need us.

02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.847
<i>Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,</i>

02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:44.202
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:47.525
<i>But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.</i>

02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:51.128
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:53.844
You'll know where to find me.

02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:32.164
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:34.205
You get used to it.

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:39.082
We've been data mining HYDRA'S files.

02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:41.448
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.365
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.560
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:49.370
There's something I got to do first.

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.806
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:55.564
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:58.444
All right, then.

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:07.290
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:10.684
You should be honoured.
That's about as close as he gets

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.530
to saying thank you.

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:14.761
Not going with him?

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.526
No.

02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:18.722
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:21.720
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:22.921
That might take a while.

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.044
I'm counting on it.

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:28.406
That thing you asked for,

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:31.081
I called in a few favours from Kiev.

02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.771
Will you do me a favour? Call that nurse.

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:38.406
She's not a nurse.

02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:40.443
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:43.442
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:45.201
She's nice.

02:05:57.680 --> 02:05:59.444
Be careful, Steve.

02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:02.009
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:15.324
You're going after him.

02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:17.006
You don't have to come with me.

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:18.241
I know.

02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:21.361
When do we start?

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:24.401
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:26.451
Everything he knows about.

02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:28.960
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:30.889
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:32.809
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:36.644
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:41.970
What we have

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.651
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:52.966
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:59.606
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:04.207
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.243
and keep them off our scent.

02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:08.681
What about the volunteers?

02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:10.445
The dead will be buried so deep

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:12.808
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:16.120
And the survivors?

02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:19.765
The twins.

02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:26.449
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.563
It's not a world of spies any more.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:32.728
Not even a world of heroes.

02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:36.451
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:40.607
There's nothing more horrifying

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.566
than a miracle.
