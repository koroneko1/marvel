1
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,368
Wait for it.

2
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,686
Can I turn on the radio?
No.

3
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,172
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,390
The last 17 occurrences
have been predictable to the second.

5
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,976
Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

6
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,812
I'm telling you, there is a connection

7
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,690
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

8
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,361
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you
to fly out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.

9
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,737
Jane?

10
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,738
I think you want to see this.

11
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,079
What is that?

12
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,748
I thought you said it was a subtle aurora!

13
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,281
Go!

14
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,187
Get closer.

15
00:02:20,612 --> 00:02:21,336
Right. Good one.

16
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,380
Go!

17
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:41,739
What are you doing?

18
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,568
I am not dying for six college credits!

19
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,961
I think that was legally your fault.

20
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:09,239
Get the first aid kit.

21
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,107
Do me a favour and don't be dead.

22
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:12,174
Please.

23
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,324
Where did he come from?

24
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:37,914
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Once,</i></font>

25
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:41,779
<font color="#ff8000"><i>mankind accepted a simple truth,</i></font>

26
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,089
<font color="#ff8000"><i>that they were not alone

27
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,016
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Some worlds man believed

28
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,612
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Others, they knew to fear.</i></font>

29
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,231
<font color="#ff8000"><i>From a realm of cold and darkness

30
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,497
<font color="#ff8000"><i>threatening to plunge the mortal world

31
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,968
<font color="#ff8000"><i>But humanity,</i></font>

32
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:32,189
<font color="#ff8000"><i>would not face this threat alone.</i></font>

33
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,103
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Our armies drove the Frost Giants

34
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,734
<font color="#ff8000"><i>The cost was great.</i></font>

35
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,698
<font color="#ff8000"><i>In the end,</i></font>

36
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,951
<font color="#ff8000"><i>their king fell.</i></font>

37
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,703
<font color="#ff8000"><i>And the source of their power
was taken from them.</i></font>

38
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,293
<font color="#ff8000"><i>With the last great war ended,</i></font>

39
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,658
<font color="#ff8000"><i>we withdrew from the other worlds</i></font>

40
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,049
<font color="#ff8000"><i>and returned home</i></font>

41
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,598
<font color="#ff8000"><i>to the Realm Eternal,</i></font>

42
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,471
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Asgard</i></font>

43
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,261
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Here we remain as a beacon of hope,</i></font>

44
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,756
<font color="#ff8000"><i>shining out across the stars.</i></font>

45
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,561
<font color="#ff8000"><i>And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,</i></font>

46
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,229
<font color="#ff8000"><i>it was Asgard</i></font>

47
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,691
<font color="#ff8000"><i>and its warriors</i></font>

48
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:33,883
<font color="#ff8000"><i>that brought peace</i></font>

49
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,865
to the universe.

50
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:41,998
But the day will come

51
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:45,029
when one of you

52
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,040
will have to defend that peace.

53
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,956
Do the Frost Giants still live?

54
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:52,447
When I'm king,

55
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,173
I'll hunt the monsters down
and slay them all!

56
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:59,069
Just as you did, Father.

57
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,940
A wise king

58
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,085
never seeks out war.

59
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:05,646
But...

60
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,428
he must always be ready for it.

61
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,925
I'm ready, Father.

62
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:26,956
So am I.

63
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,909
Only one of you can ascend
to the throne.

64
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:32,257
But both of you,

65
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:34,764
were born to be kings.

66
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,110
Oh, please.

67
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,741
Thor...

68
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:56,979
Odinson,

69
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,237
my heir,

70
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:04,769
my firstborn.

71
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:10,389
So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir,

72
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:13,102
forged in the heart of a...

73
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:14,574
dying star,

74
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,296
its power has no equal,

75
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,659
as a weapon to destroy...

76
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,705
or as a tool to build.

77
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:25,841
It is a fit companion for a king.

78
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,170
I have defended Asgard

79
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:33,781
and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms

80
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,920
from the time of the great beginning.

81
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,454
Though the day has come...

82
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,845
Do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?

83
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,486
I swear.

84
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,795
And do you swear
to preserve the peace?

85
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:15,285
I swear.

86
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,007
Do you swear

87
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:20,996
to cast aside all selfish ambition

88
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:24,088
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?

89
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,360
I swear!

90
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:26,955
Then, on this day,

91
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,442
I Odin Allfather,

92
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,399
proclaim you...

93
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,690
The Frost Giants!

94
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,820
The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!

95
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,955
They have paid, with their lives.

96
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,253
The Destroyer did its work,

97
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,745
the Casket is safe and all is well.

98
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,079
All is Well?

99
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:48,390
They broke into the weapons vault!

100
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,421
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

101
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,763
They didn't.
Well, I want to know why?

102
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,883
I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.

103
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,764
He just broke your truce!

104
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:02,905
They know you are vulnerable!

105
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,353
What action would you take?

106
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,134
March into Jotunheim
as you once did.

107
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:08,972
Teach them a lesson.

108
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,571
Break their spirits so they'll never
dare try to cross our borders again.

109
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,050
You're thinking only as a warrior.

110
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:15,316
This was an act of war!

111
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,652
It was the act of but a few,
doomed to fail.

112
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,156
Look how far they got!

113
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:21,618
We will find the breach in our defenses
and it will be sealed.

114
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:23,250
As King of Asgard...

115
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:24,843
But you're not king!

116
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:29,861
Not yet.

117
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,692
It's unwise to be in my company
right now, Brother.

118
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,160
This was to be my day of triumph.

119
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,271
It'll come.

120
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,778
In time.

121
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,049
What's this?

122
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,219
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

123
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,812
About the Frost Giants,
about Laufey, about everything.

124
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,702
If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defenses once,

125
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,397
who's to say they won't try again?

126
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,610
Next time with an army.
Exactly.

127
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,444
There's nothing you can do
without defying Father.

128
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:39,649
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I know that look.

129
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,847
That's the only way
to ensure the safety of our borders.

130
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:42,974
Thor, it's madness.

131
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:44,222
Madness?

132
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,733
What sort of madness?

133
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:48,001
We're going to Jotunheim.

134
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,741
What?

135
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,832
This isn't like a journey to Earth

136
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,130
where you summon
a little lightning and thunder,

137
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:56,979
and the mortals worship you as a god.

138
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,159
This is Jotunheim.

139
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:01,517
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

140
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,556
defeated their armies
and took their Casket.

141
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,426
We would just be looking for answers.

142
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,725
It is forbidden!

143
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,940
My friends, have you forgotten
all that we have done together?

144
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,067
Fandral, Hogun.

145
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,025
Who led you
into the most glorious of battles?

146
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,864
You did.

147
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,652
And Volstagg,
to delicacies so succulent,

148
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,742
you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?

149
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:27,492
You did.

150
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:28,457
Yes!

151
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:31,141
And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea that,

152
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,306
a young maiden could be one
of the fiercest warriors

153
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:34,602
this realm has ever known?

154
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:35,423
I did.

155
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:37,662
True, but I supported you Sif.

156
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:39,408
My friends,

157
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,930
we're going to Jotunheim.

158
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:34,909
You leave this to me.

159
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,727
Good Heimdall...
You're not dressed warmly enough.

160
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,189
I'm sorry?

161
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,329
Do you think that
you can deceive me?

162
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:45,202
You must be mistaken...
Enough!

163
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,745
Heimdall, may we pass?

164
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,282
Never has an enemy,

165
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:56,594
slipped my watch until this day.

166
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:00,835
I wish to know how that happened.

167
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,305
Then tell no one where we have gone
until we've returned.

168
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,801
Understand?

169
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,151
What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?

170
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,192
Be warned.

171
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,918
I will honor my sworn oath
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

172
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:06,398
If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard,

173
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,778
Bifrost will remain closed to you

174
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,269
and you'll be left to die
in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

175
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,444
Couldn't you just
leave the bridge open for us?

176
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,824
To leave the bridge open

177
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,056
would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost

178
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:21,194
and destroy Jotunheim
with you upon it.

179
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,467
I have no plans to die today.

180
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:24,851
None do.

181
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,801
We shouldn't be here.

182
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,143
Let's move.

183
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,789
Where are they?

184
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,203
Hiding,

185
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:19,945
as cowards always do.

186
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,595
You've come a long way to die,
Asgardians.

187
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,611
I am Thor Odinson!

188
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:39,593
We know who you are.

189
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,090
How did your people get into Asgarol?

190
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,187
The House of Odin...

191
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,446
is full of traitors.

192
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,322
Do not dishonor my father's name
with your lies!

193
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,959
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

194
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,031
And why have you come here?

195
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,414
To make peace?

196
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,279
You long for battle.

197
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:09,103
You crave it.

198
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,146
You're nothing but a boy,

199
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,008
trying to prove himself a man.

200
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,768
This boy,

201
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:18,992
has grown tired of your mockery.

202
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:27,953
Thor, stop and think.

203
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,796
Look around you,
we're outnumbered.

204
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:31,520
Know your place, Brother.

205
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,845
You know not
what your actions would unleash.

206
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,117
I do.

207
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,770
Go now, while I still allow it.

208
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,155
We will accept...

209
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,417
your most gracious offer.

210
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,112
Come on, Brother.

211
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,863
Run back home, little princess.

212
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,322
Damn.

213
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,763
Next?

214
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,354
At least make it a challenge for me!

215
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,473
That's more like it.

216
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,487
Don't let them touch you!

217
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,390
Thor!

218
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,970
We must go!
Then go!

219
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,828
Run!

220
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,963
Thor!

221
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,235
Heimdall!

222
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:12,889
Open the bridge!

223
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,788
Father! We'll finish them together!

224
00:26:21,908 --> 00:26:23,251
Silence!

225
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:30,531
Allfather.

226
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,930
You look weary.

227
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,786
Laufey,

228
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,730
end this now.

229
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,271
Your boy sought this out.

230
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,052
You're right.

231
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,473
And these are the actions of a boy,

232
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:48,164
treat them as such.

233
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,241
You and I can end this,

234
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,217
here and now,

235
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:53,032
before there is further bloodshed.

236
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,429
We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather.

237
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,823
He'll get what he came for.

238
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,772
War

239
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:03,522
and death.

240
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,343
So be it.

241
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,525
Why did you bring us back?

242
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,609
Do you realize what you've done?

243
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,558
What you've started?
I was protecting my home.

244
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,163
You cannot even protect your friends!

245
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:37,919
How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?

246
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,914
Get him to the healing room! Now!

247
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:43,194
There won't be a kingdom
to protect if you're afraid to act.

248
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,438
The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.

249
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,058
That's pride and vanity talking,
not leadership.

250
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:52,528
You've forgotten everything I taught you

251
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:54,171
about a warrior's patience.

252
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,701
While you wait and be patient,
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

253
00:27:58,212 --> 00:27:59,384
The old ways are done.

254
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,304
You'd stand giving speeches
while Asgard falls.

255
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,534
You are a vain,

256
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:04,540
greedy,

257
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:05,905
cruel boy!

258
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:08,472
And you are an old man and a fool!

259
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,469
Yes.

260
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:18,813
I was a fool

261
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:21,603
to think you were ready.

262
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:22,792
Father...

263
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,448
Thor Odinson,

264
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,550
you have betrayed
the express command of your king.

265
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:37,429
Through your arrogance and stupidity,

266
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:40,467
you've opened these peaceful realms
and innocent lives

267
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,339
to the horror and desolation of war!

268
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,129
You are...

269
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:54,282
unworthy of these realms!

270
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,658
You're unworthy of your title!

271
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:58,605
You're unworthy

272
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,661
of the loved ones...

273
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,091
you have betrayed.

274
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,598
I now take from you,

275
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:18,741
your power!

276
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:21,384
In the name of my father

277
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,420
and his father before,

278
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,027
I, Odin Allfather,

279
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:28,098
cast you out!

280
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,460
Whosoever holds this hammer,

281
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,532
if he be worthy,
shall possess the power of Thor.

282
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,518
I think that was legally your fault.

283
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,905
Get the first aid Kit.

284
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,587
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

285
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,850
Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.

286
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,645
Where did he come from?

287
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,881
You alright?

288
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:38,177
Hammer?

289
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,473
Hammer?

290
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:40,743
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.

291
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:41,955
It's pretty obvious.

292
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,398
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

293
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:47,263
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

294
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,497
Jane, we have to take him
to the hospital.

295
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:52,818
Father!
He's fine, look at him.

296
00:30:52,863 --> 00:30:54,033
Heimdall!

297
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:56,869
I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

298
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:58,820
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

299
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:01,063
You. What realm is this?

300
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,222
Alfheim? Nornheim?

301
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:04,275
New Mexico?

302
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:06,076
You dare threaten me,

303
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:08,198
Thor, with so puny a weapon?

304
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:13,821
What? He was freaking me out!

305
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,500
Next time you decide
to taser somebody,

306
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,685
make sure he's already in the car, ok?

307
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,076
Jane!

308
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:22,187
Come on.

309
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,014
Name?

310
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,711
He said it was Thor?

311
00:31:44,197 --> 00:31:47,417
T-H-O-R.

312
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,384
And your relationship to him?

313
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:50,490
I've never met him before.

314
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,039
Until she hit him with a car.

315
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,125
I grazed him,

316
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:54,981
but she tasered him.

317
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:56,196
Yes, I did.

318
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,126
Hi.

319
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:01,545
Just taking a little blood.

320
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:04,087
How dare you attack
the son of Odin?

321
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,474
I need some help!
Some help!

322
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:08,381
Call security!

323
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,428
Security to ER 3, stat!

324
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:27,066
You're no match for the Mighty...

325
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:31,480
You don't think this was just
a magnetic storm, do you?

326
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,062
Look, the lensing around these edges

327
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,891
is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

328
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,145
A what?

329
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,391
I thought you were a science major?
Political science.

330
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,788
She was the only applicant.

331
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:45,143
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

332
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:46,397
between two different points
of space-time.

333
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,316
It's a wormhole.

334
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:48,239
Erik,

335
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:50,054
look. What do you see?

336
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:50,902
Stars.

337
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,660
Yeah, but not our stars.

338
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:56,464
See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,

339
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,580
and unless Ursa Minor decided
to take a day off,

340
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:02,090
these are someone
else's constellations.

341
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,533
Hey! Check this out.

342
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,167
No, it can't be.

343
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,590
I think I left something at the hospital.

344
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,273
It's not possible!

345
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,454
He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.

346
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:00,903
Oh, my God.

347
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:06,732
I just lost my most important
piece of evidence.

348
00:35:06,757 --> 00:35:07,655
Typical.

349
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:08,645
So now what?

350
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:09,901
We find him.

351
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,443
Did you see what he did in there?

352
00:35:11,665 --> 00:35:13,383
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

353
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,747
Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,

354
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,818
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

355
00:35:18,723 --> 00:35:19,610
Ok.

356
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:21,761
So we're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?

357
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,431
Exactly.

358
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:28,912
What?

359
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,299
I'm so sorry.

360
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:33,261
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

361
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,552
I got it, I got it.

362
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,586
Come on, kick it in now!

363
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,633
Did it Work?

364
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,118
Sir,

365
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:37,507
we found it.

366
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,491
You know, for a crazy
homeless person, he's...

367
00:36:46,993 --> 00:36:47,928
pretty cut.

368
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,633
Hey, sorry I tased you!

369
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,431
Excuse me, excuse me!

370
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,992
What is this?

371
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,310
My ex.

372
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,803
Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

373
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:17,608
They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

374
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,657
They will suffice.

375
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,739
You're welcome.

376
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:22,578
This mortal form has grown weak.

377
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:24,332
I need sustenance.

378
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:45,271
We should never have let him go.

379
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,015
There was no stopping him.

380
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,066
Well, at least
he's only banished, not dead.

381
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,516
Which is what we'd all be

382
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,713
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

383
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:01,113
How did the guard even know?

384
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:02,544
I told him.

385
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:05,281
What?

386
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:07,691
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

387
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,781
He should be flogged for taking so long.

388
00:38:09,797 --> 00:38:11,001
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

389
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,236
You told the guard?

390
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,585
I saved our lives.

391
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,590
And Thor's.

392
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,680
I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.

393
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:20,882
Loki.

394
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,497
You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change his mind.

395
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,099
And if I do, then what?

396
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,416
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

397
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,270
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

398
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:34,791
You saw how he was today.

399
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,296
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

400
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:43,828
He may speak of the good of Asgard,

401
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,438
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

402
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,748
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

403
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:51,159
Laufey said

404
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,499
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

405
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,821
A master of magic,

406
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:59,127
could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

407
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,929
Loki's always been one for mischief,

408
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:05,032
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

409
00:39:26,126 --> 00:39:27,072
Stop!

410
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,454
Am I cursed?

411
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,782
No.

412
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,415
What am I?

413
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,804
You're my son.

414
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,798
What more than that?

415
00:39:58,808 --> 00:40:02,468
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?

416
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,202
No.

417
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,286
In the aftermath of the battle
I went into the temple,

418
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:16,844
and I found a baby.

419
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,013
Small for a giant's offspring.

420
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,239
Abandoned, suffering,

421
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:27,780
left to die.

422
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,813
Laufey's son.

423
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,235
Laufey's son.

424
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:37,953
Yes.

425
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:42,959
Why?

426
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,514
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,

427
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:46,727
why would you take me?

428
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:48,311
You were an innocent child.

429
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:48,932
No.

430
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,925
You took me for a purpose.

431
00:40:51,396 --> 00:40:52,327
What was it?

432
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,898
Tell me!

433
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:02,621
I thought we could unite
our kingdoms one day.

434
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:05,972
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

435
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,392
Through you.

436
00:41:07,816 --> 00:41:08,677
What?

437
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,795
But those plans no longer matter.

438
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,836
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

439
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:19,778
locked up, here until you might
have use of me.

440
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:21,159
Why do you twist my words?

441
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:23,273
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

442
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,276
why didn't you?

443
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,821
You're my son.

444
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:28,683
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

445
00:41:29,073 --> 00:41:29,503
Why,

446
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,634
because I'm the monster

447
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,822
parents tell their children about
at night?

448
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:36,038
No, no.
You know, it all makes sense now!

449
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,899
Why you favored Thor
all these years!

450
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:41,891
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

451
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:45,458
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

452
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,783
Guards!

453
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,574
Guards, please, help!

454
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,368
How'd you get inside that cloud?

455
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,442
Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts

456
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:21,854
and still be this hungry?

457
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,868
This drink, I like it.

458
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,004
I know. It's great, right?

459
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:30,624
Another!

460
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,682
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

461
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,899
What was that?
It was delicious. I want another.

462
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:42,053
Well, you could have just said so.
I just did.

463
00:42:42,055 --> 00:42:44,042
No, I mean, ask nicely.

464
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:45,311
I meant no disrespect.

465
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,836
Alright. Well, no more smashing.

466
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,448
Deal?

467
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,903
You have my word.

468
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,005
Good.

469
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,074
The usual, please, Izzy.

470
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,233
You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.

471
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,515
They're saying some kind
of satellite landed out in the desert.

472
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:05,621
Yeah, we were having
a good time with it

473
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,497
until the Feds showed up.

474
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:10,066
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

475
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,892
Yeah.

476
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,430
Oh, my God.

477
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:13,861
This is going on Facebook. Smile.

478
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,106
What did it look like, the satellite?

479
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,766
I don't know anything about satellites,

480
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,227
but it was heavy.

481
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,554
I mean,

482
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,369
nobody could lift it.

483
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,944
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

484
00:43:29,478 --> 00:43:30,424
Which way?

485
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,272
50 miles west of here.

486
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,819
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

487
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:38,762
Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.

488
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:44,722
Dumbass!

489
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,527
Where are you going?

490
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,834
50 miles west of here.
Why?

491
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:51,463
To get what belongs to me.

492
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:53,295
Oh, so you own a satellite now?

493
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,343
It's not what they say it is.

494
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:55,506
Well, whatever it is,

495
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,851
the government seems to think
it's theirs.

496
00:43:56,853 --> 00:43:57,366
So,

497
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:59,215
you just intend to go in there
and take it?

498
00:43:59,217 --> 00:43:59,956
Yes.

499
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,814
If you take me there now,

500
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,692
I'll tell you everything
you wish to know.

501
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,151
Everything?
Yes.

502
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,026
All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

503
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,068
Myeu-muh?

504
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:11,230
What's Myeu-muh?

505
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,557
Can I have a word, Jane?

506
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,474
Please don't do this.

507
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,909
You saw what I saw last night.

508
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,415
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

509
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,462
But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.

510
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,023
But he's promising us the answers.
He's delusional.

511
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,379
Listen to what he's saying.

512
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,793
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

513
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,932
It's the stories I grew up
with as a child.

514
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,851
I'm just going to drive him.
That's it.

515
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,767
He's dangerous, Jane.

516
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,200
I'm sorry,

517
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:49,901
but I can't take you.

518
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:51,571
Then this is where we say goodbye.

519
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:02,886
Thank you?

520
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,485
Jane Foster,

521
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,225
Erik Selvig,

522
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,472
Darcy,

523
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,440
farewell.

524
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,505
Alright.

525
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,600
Back to work.

526
00:45:37,173 --> 00:45:37,952
Hey!

527
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,120
That's my stuff!

528
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,468
What the hell is going on here?

529
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,204
Ms. Foster,
I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

530
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,960
Is that supposed to mean something
to me?

531
00:45:49,962 --> 00:45:51,166
You can't do this!
Jane!

532
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,551
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

533
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,675
Let it go? This is my life.

534
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,916
We're investigating a security threat.

535
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,882
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

536
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,810
By appropriate, do you mean steal?

537
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:07,181
Here, this should more than
compensate you for your trouble.

538
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,932
I can't just buy replacements
at Radio Shack,

539
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,780
I made most of this equipment myself!

540
00:46:11,843 --> 00:46:13,070
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

541
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,274
And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!

542
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:17,631
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster,

543
00:46:17,771 --> 00:46:18,861
but we're the good guys.

544
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:19,855
So are we!

545
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,332
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

546
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:26,282
And everything I know
about this phenomenon

547
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,279
is either in this lab or in this book.

548
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:30,036
And you can't just take this away...

549
00:46:30,428 --> 00:46:31,196
Hey!

550
00:46:31,653 --> 00:46:34,090
Jane! Easy! Easy.

551
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:34,953
Jane...

552
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,825
Thank you for your cooperation.

553
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,280
Years of research,

554
00:46:58,858 --> 00:46:59,587
gone.

555
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:02,247
They even took my iPod.

556
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:04,317
What about the backups?

557
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,537
They took our backups.

558
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,723
They took the backups of our backups.

559
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,286
They were extremely thorough.

560
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:11,850
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

561
00:47:11,852 --> 00:47:13,942
Could you please stop with your iPod?

562
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,012
Who are these people?

563
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,551
I knew this scientist.

564
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,389
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

565
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,688
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up and...

566
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:29,059
he wasn't heard from again.

567
00:47:30,073 --> 00:47:31,679
They're not gonna do that to us.

568
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:33,361
I'm gonna get everything back.

569
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,601
Come on, please.

570
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,245
Let me contact one of my colleagues.

571
00:47:36,247 --> 00:47:38,334
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

572
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,331
I'll e-mail him and...

573
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,430
maybe he can help.

574
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:43,689
They took your laptop, too.

575
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,665
Allfather,
we must speak with you urgently.

576
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,513
My friends.

577
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,164
Where's Odin?

578
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,280
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

579
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,733
Mother fears
he may never awaken again.

580
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,581
We would speak with her.

581
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,711
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

582
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:29,660
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

583
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,716
Your king.

584
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,050
My King,

585
00:48:51,257 --> 00:48:54,274
we would ask that you end
Thor's banishment.

586
00:48:59,005 --> 00:49:02,528
My first command cannot be
to undo the Allfather's last.

587
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,326
We're on the brink of war
with Jotunheim.

588
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,327
Our people need
a sense of continuity,

589
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,539
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

590
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,582
All of us must stand together

591
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,045
for the good of Asgard.

592
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,729
Yes, of course.

593
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,142
Good. Then you will wait for my word.

594
00:49:26,815 --> 00:49:27,732
If I may...

595
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,027
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty...

596
00:49:32,604 --> 00:49:33,719
to perhaps reconsider...

597
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,629
We're done!

598
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,983
I need a horse!

599
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,450
We don't have horses.

600
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:45,367
Just dogs, cats, birds...

601
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,472
Then give me one of those
large enough to ride.

602
00:50:48,162 --> 00:50:50,123
Hey, you still need a lift?

603
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,474
I've never done anything
like this before.

604
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,015
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

605
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,798
Many times.

606
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,247
But you're brave to do it.

607
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,747
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

608
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,801
I don't really have much left to lose.

609
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,601
Yeah, but you're clever.

610
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,917
Far more clever than anyone else
in this realm.

611
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:18,494
Realm?

612
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:20,112
Realm?

613
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,691
You think me strange.
Yeah, I do.

614
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,980
Good strange or...

615
00:51:25,138 --> 00:51:26,123
bad strange?

616
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:28,044
I'm not quite sure yet.

617
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,671
I'm sorry.

618
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,181
But who are you?

619
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,556
Really?

620
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,735
You'll see soon enough.

621
00:51:49,728 --> 00:51:51,310
You promised me answers.

622
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,739
What you seek, it's a bridge.

623
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,999
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

624
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:00,353
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

625
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,301
God, I hope you're not crazy.

626
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,132
I never get used to seeing him like this.

627
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,785
He's put it off for so long now,

628
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:22,591
that I fear...

629
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,808
How long will it last?

630
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,505
I don't know.

631
00:52:28,507 --> 00:52:30,197
This time it's different.

632
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:31,913
We were unprepared.

633
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,382
So why did he lie?

634
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:40,150
He kept the truth from you
so that you would never feel different.

635
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,998
You are our son, Loki,

636
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,460
and we, your family.

637
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,339
We mustn't lose hope
that your father will return to us.

638
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,338
And your brother.

639
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,599
What hope is there for Thor?

640
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,436
There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.

641
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,796
That's no satellite crash!

642
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,212
They would have hauled
the wreckage away,

643
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,807
they wouldn't have built
a city around it.

644
00:53:40,177 --> 00:53:41,970
You're going to need this.
What?

645
00:53:42,644 --> 00:53:43,683
Wait, why?

646
00:53:47,158 --> 00:53:48,136
Now stay here.

647
00:53:48,885 --> 00:53:50,033
Once I have Mjolnir,

648
00:53:50,035 --> 00:53:51,905
I will return the items
they've stolen from you.

649
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,381
Deal?

650
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:54,753
No.

651
00:53:55,095 --> 00:53:56,254
Look what's down there.

652
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,359
You think you're just gonna walk in,
grab our stuff and walk out?

653
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,219
No. I'm going to fly out.

654
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,210
Sir, feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

655
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:13,790
Tech's barely working as it is,

656
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,886
with all the interference
that thing's giving off.

657
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,979
And we've got a commercial aircraft
coming right over us.

658
00:54:18,995 --> 00:54:22,090
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

659
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,332
Reroute it like all the others.

660
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:25,575
Hold a sec.

661
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,170
We've got something
outside the fence,

662
00:54:27,172 --> 00:54:28,068
west side.

663
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,716
<i>Delancey, Jackson.</i>

664
00:54:29,718 --> 00:54:31,716
<i>West side perimeter.
Go check it out.</i>

665
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:35,577
There it is.

666
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,081
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

667
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,548
Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.

668
00:55:09,648 --> 00:55:11,767
<i>You've reached Dr Erik Selvig.</i>

669
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:13,846
<i>Please leave me a message.</i>

670
00:55:14,638 --> 00:55:15,968
Hi, Erik, it's me.

671
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,653
Don't worry, I'm fine but...

672
00:55:18,135 --> 00:55:20,602
just in case you don't hear
from me in the next hour just...

673
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:23,401
come by the crater site
and try and find me, ok?

674
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,065
I did exactly what you told me not to.
I'm sorry.

675
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,787
So sorry. Bye.

676
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,999
Bravo quadrant, move!

677
00:55:46,705 --> 00:55:47,983
Entering south tunnel!

678
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,435
Negative, negative.
I have no comms.

679
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,330
Target sighted, east tunnel!

680
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,411
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

681
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,275
Moving north!

682
00:56:44,316 --> 00:56:45,317
What have we got?

683
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,030
There's a massive electromagnetic
surge coming off that thing.

684
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,469
Systems are barely coping.

685
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,987
Barton?

686
00:56:51,214 --> 00:56:52,140
Talk to me.

687
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,828
You want me to slow him down, sir?

688
00:56:56,202 --> 00:56:58,291
Or are you sending in more guys
for him to beat up?

689
00:56:58,427 --> 00:56:59,714
I'll let you know.

690
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,851
You're big.

691
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,428
Fought bigger.

692
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,560
Better call it, Coulson,

693
00:58:05,006 --> 00:58:06,763
because I'm starting
to root for this guy.

694
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:28,753
Last chance, sir.

695
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,849
<i>Wait. I want to see this.</i>

696
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,235
Alright, show's over.

697
00:59:41,237 --> 00:59:42,708
Ground units, move in.

698
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,632
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

699
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,916
I can't just leave him there!
Why?

700
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,055
You didn't see what I saw!

701
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,139
Look!
Look, it's Myeu-muh.

702
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,238
Where'd you find this?

703
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,648
The children's section.

704
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,031
I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.

705
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:55,956
But you're the one
who's always pushing me to...

706
01:00:56,103 --> 01:00:58,548
chase down every possibility,
every alternative!

707
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,699
I'm talking about science, not magic!

708
01:01:00,701 --> 01:01:03,139
Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.

709
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:05,702
Arthur C. Clarke.
Who wrote science fiction.

710
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:08,489
A precursor to science fact!
In some cases, yeah.

711
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:10,276
Well, if there is
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

712
01:01:10,278 --> 01:01:11,624
then there is something
on the other side.

713
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,410
And advanced beings
could have crossed it!

714
01:01:13,756 --> 01:01:14,504
Jane.

715
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,637
A primitive culture like the Vikings
might have worshipped them as deities.

716
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,630
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

717
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:29,247
You made my men,
some of the most,

718
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:31,632
highly trained professionals in
the world look like a bunch of...

719
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:33,643
minimum-wage mall cops.

720
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,654
That's hurtful.

721
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,049
In my experience,

722
01:01:39,216 --> 01:01:41,244
it takes someone
who's received similar training

723
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,123
to do what you did to them.

724
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,792
Why don't you tell me
where you received your training?

725
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,217
Pakistan?

726
01:01:48,613 --> 01:01:49,495
Chechnya?

727
01:01:49,848 --> 01:01:50,855
Afghanistan?

728
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,848
No, you strike me
more as the soldier of fortune type.

729
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,200
Where was it?

730
01:01:57,779 --> 01:01:58,819
South Africa?

731
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,251
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

732
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,022
Who are you?

733
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,740
One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.

734
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,192
We're good at that.

735
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,499
Don't go anywhere.

736
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:31,758
Loki!

737
01:02:32,299 --> 01:02:33,381
What are you doing here?

738
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,078
I had to see you.

739
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,090
What's happened?

740
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,417
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

741
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:42,427
Let me explain to Father.

742
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,657
Father is dead.

743
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:50,950
What?

744
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,421
Your banishment,

745
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,634
the threat of a new war,

746
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,819
it was too much for him to bear.

747
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,147
You mustn't blame yourself.

748
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,155
I know that you loved him.

749
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,278
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

750
01:03:13,943 --> 01:03:16,241
It was so cruel to put
the hammer within your reach,

751
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,112
knowing that you could never lift it.

752
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,004
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

753
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,831
Can I come home?

754
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:36,086
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

755
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,149
Yes, but couldn't we find a way.

756
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:38,984
And Mother...

757
01:03:39,902 --> 01:03:42,343
has forbidden your return.

758
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,980
This is goodbye, Brother.

759
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:51,309
I'm so sorry.

760
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,224
No.

761
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,279
I am sorry.

762
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,844
Thank you for coming here.

763
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,937
Farewell.

764
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,280
Goodbye.

765
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,534
Goodbye?

766
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,292
I just got back.

767
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,295
Sir?

768
01:05:11,566 --> 01:05:12,768
He's got a visitor.

769
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,837
His name is Donald Blake?

770
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,756
Dr. Donald Blake.

771
01:05:21,913 --> 01:05:23,859
You have dangerous coworkers,
Dr. Selvig.

772
01:05:24,156 --> 01:05:27,462
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.

773
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,067
That was years of his life, gone!

774
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:35,342
You can understand
how a man could go off like that.

775
01:05:35,757 --> 01:05:37,807
A big, faceless organization like yours

776
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,986
coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...

777
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,360
That's how he put it.

778
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,570
That still doesn't explain

779
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:46,329
how he managed
to tear through our security.

780
01:05:46,918 --> 01:05:48,009
Steroids!

781
01:05:48,495 --> 01:05:50,244
He's a bit of a fitness nut.

782
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,439
Sir?

783
01:05:57,765 --> 01:05:58,952
It says here that he's an M.D.

784
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,336
Well, he is! Or he was.

785
01:06:01,376 --> 01:06:04,073
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

786
01:06:04,245 --> 01:06:05,764
A brilliant physicist.

787
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,540
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

788
01:06:10,737 --> 01:06:13,274
Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny!

789
01:06:14,162 --> 01:06:15,530
There you are.

790
01:06:15,665 --> 01:06:18,097
You're gonna be alright.
I'm taking you home now.

791
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,705
Dr. Selvig!

792
01:06:35,112 --> 01:06:37,149
Just keep him away from the bars.

793
01:06:38,064 --> 01:06:39,066
I will!

794
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,303
Where are we going?

795
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:43,986
To get a drink.

796
01:06:44,513 --> 01:06:45,488
Follow them.

797
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,914
You know, I had it all backwards.

798
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,644
I had it all wrong.

799
01:07:01,502 --> 01:07:04,648
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

800
01:07:05,536 --> 01:07:07,288
You start asking the right questions.

801
01:07:11,685 --> 01:07:13,155
For the first time in...

802
01:07:14,545 --> 01:07:16,305
my life I have...

803
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:19,948
no idea what I'm supposed to do.

804
01:07:21,313 --> 01:07:23,821
Anyone who's ever going
to find his way in this world

805
01:07:24,337 --> 01:07:27,107
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.

806
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:30,895
Thank you for what you've done.

807
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,051
No, don't thank me.

808
01:07:32,537 --> 01:07:33,793
I only did it for Jane.

809
01:07:35,136 --> 01:07:37,292
Her father and I
taught at university together.

810
01:07:38,066 --> 01:07:39,255
He was a good man.

811
01:07:40,605 --> 01:07:41,697
He never listened.

812
01:07:42,962 --> 01:07:44,130
Neither did I.

813
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,822
My father was trying
to teach me something,

814
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,820
but I was too stupid to see it.

815
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,047
I don't know if you're delusional or...

816
01:07:53,558 --> 01:07:54,951
if you're pulling some kind of con,

817
01:07:54,982 --> 01:07:55,974
I don't care.

818
01:07:56,775 --> 01:07:58,118
I just care about her.

819
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:01,252
I've seen the way she looks at you.

820
01:08:05,101 --> 01:08:07,508
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

821
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,533
Good.

822
01:08:09,528 --> 01:08:11,160
In that case, I'll buy you another round,

823
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:13,449
and you leave town tonight.

824
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,129
Two boilermakers.

825
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:13,463
Kill him.

826
01:09:15,163 --> 01:09:17,257
After all I've done for you?

827
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:24,203
So you're the one
who showed us the way into Asgard.

828
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,472
That was just a bit of fun, really.

829
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,754
To ruin my brother's big day.

830
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:35,555
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

831
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,981
I will hear you.

832
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,109
I will conceal you,

833
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:47,067
and a handful of your soldiers,

834
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:52,731
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

835
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,865
Why not kill him yourself?

836
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,752
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly

837
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:02,228
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

838
01:10:03,264 --> 01:10:06,359
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you

839
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,964
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

840
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,078
Glory.

841
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,120
I...

842
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,475
accept.

843
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,038
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

844
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:34,046
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

845
01:10:34,868 --> 01:10:36,120
You were shrouded from me,

846
01:10:36,122 --> 01:10:38,330
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

847
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,996
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

848
01:10:42,421 --> 01:10:43,821
Or perhaps someone has found a way

849
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,725
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

850
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,416
You have great power, Heimdall.

851
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,466
Did Odin ever fear you?

852
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,175
No.
And why is that?

853
01:10:58,555 --> 01:11:00,218
Because he is my king,

854
01:11:00,362 --> 01:11:01,565
and I am sworn to obey him.

855
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,166
He was your king,

856
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:05,817
and you're sworn to obey me now.

857
01:11:07,072 --> 01:11:08,006
Yes?

858
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,284
Yes.

859
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,526
Then you will open
the Bifrost to no one

860
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:21,118
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

861
01:11:35,797 --> 01:11:36,655
Oh, my God.

862
01:11:36,985 --> 01:11:38,003
Is he ok?

863
01:11:38,242 --> 01:11:40,138
He's fine. Not injured at all.

864
01:11:41,379 --> 01:11:42,694
I'm sorry, my friend.

865
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,568
What happened?
We drank, we fought,

866
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:46,275
he made his ancestors proud.

867
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:47,991
Put him on the bed.

868
01:11:59,868 --> 01:12:03,105
I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.

869
01:12:04,012 --> 01:12:05,905
But you ought to be.

870
01:12:17,353 --> 01:12:18,967
Are these your chambers?

871
01:12:19,789 --> 01:12:22,515
It's more of a temporary living situation.

872
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:27,541
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

873
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:28,936
Actually...

874
01:12:29,773 --> 01:12:31,041
I never have guests.

875
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,182
That's not the right place for it.

876
01:12:36,403 --> 01:12:37,778
I'm sorry.

877
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:42,139
Can we go outside?

878
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,582
Yes, of course.

879
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,520
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep or...

880
01:12:52,913 --> 01:12:56,576
I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

881
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,968
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

882
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,610
I'm really glad you're safe.

883
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,352
You've been very kind to me,

884
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,457
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

885
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,274
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

886
01:13:15,276 --> 01:13:17,324
so I think that kind of evens things out.

887
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,519
Perhaps I had it coming.

888
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,607
Oh, my God!

889
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,415
I don't believe it!

890
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,438
It was all I could get back.

891
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,083
I'm sorry it's not as much as
I promised.

892
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:37,678
No, no, this is great! This is...

893
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,688
I don't have to start from scratch now.

894
01:13:40,314 --> 01:13:41,236
Thank you.

895
01:13:46,431 --> 01:13:47,594
What's wrong?

896
01:13:49,089 --> 01:13:51,008
S.H.l.E.L.D.
Whatever they are,

897
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,637
they're gonna do
everything in their power

898
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:57,081
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

899
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,518
No, Jane.

900
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,358
Listen to me. You must not give up.

901
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,470
You must finish what you've started.

902
01:14:03,471 --> 01:14:05,025
Why?
Because you're right.

903
01:14:06,019 --> 01:14:06,735
Here, look.

904
01:14:10,043 --> 01:14:11,973
Your ancestors called it magic,

905
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:13,494
and you call it science.

906
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,703
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

907
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,542
What is that?

908
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,075
My father...

909
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:38,499
explained it to me like this,
that your world

910
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:41,494
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

911
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:45,037
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

912
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:46,486
the Worlds Tree.

913
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,074
Now you see it every day
without realizing.

914
01:14:50,696 --> 01:14:53,201
The images glimpsed through.
What did you call it?

915
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,892
This Hooble Telescope.

916
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:57,081
Hubble.

917
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,783
Hubble Telescope.

918
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,297
Tell me more.

919
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,519
So, the Nine Realms.

920
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,755
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

921
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,257
This is Alfheim.

922
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,000
Vanaheim.

923
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:13,833
Jotunheim.

924
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,619
And Asgard.

925
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,876
And that's where I come from.

926
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,957
Thank you, Jane.

927
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,539
Our dearest friend banished,

928
01:15:42,588 --> 01:15:45,113
Loki on the throne,
Asgard on the brink of war,

929
01:15:45,115 --> 01:15:46,834
yet you've managed to consume

930
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,191
four wild boar,
six pheasant, a side of beef,

931
01:15:50,207 --> 01:15:51,751
and two casks of ale.

932
01:15:51,753 --> 01:15:53,771
Shame on you. Don't you care?

933
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:56,580
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

934
01:15:56,873 --> 01:15:58,311
Stop it, both of you!

935
01:15:58,888 --> 01:15:59,889
Stop.

936
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,754
We all know what we have to do.

937
01:16:02,803 --> 01:16:03,694
We must go.

938
01:16:06,564 --> 01:16:08,310
We must find Thor.

939
01:16:09,872 --> 01:16:10,873
It's treason.

940
01:16:11,084 --> 01:16:12,836
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

941
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,911
Thor would do the same for us.

942
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,310
Now shush.

943
01:16:19,178 --> 01:16:21,244
Heimdall might be watching.

944
01:16:26,552 --> 01:16:28,669
Heimdall demands your presence.

945
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,632
We're doomed.

946
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:38,573
You would defy the commands of Loki,
our king,

947
01:16:39,325 --> 01:16:41,748
break every oath you
have taken as warriors,

948
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:44,094
and commit treason
to bring Thor back?

949
01:16:44,456 --> 01:16:45,602
Yes.
Good.

950
01:16:46,671 --> 01:16:47,793
So you'll help us?

951
01:16:47,934 --> 01:16:49,808
I am bound by honor to our king.

952
01:16:50,201 --> 01:16:52,281
I cannot open the bridge to you.

953
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:54,784
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

954
01:16:54,967 --> 01:16:56,149
Now what do we do?

955
01:16:57,997 --> 01:16:58,556
Look!

956
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:19,583
What the hell was that?

957
01:17:19,585 --> 01:17:21,676
I don't know, sir. We got massive
energy readings out of nowhere

958
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:23,964
and then they just disappeared.
15 miles due northwest.

959
01:17:24,212 --> 01:17:25,216
Let's go take a look.

960
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:51,397
Thank you.

961
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,427
Thank you.
You're very welcome.

962
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,046
<i>Base to Team 2,</i>

963
01:18:02,048 --> 01:18:03,688
<i>we've got activity outside the town.</i>

964
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:04,888
<i>Stay on your target.</i>

965
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:16,734
Ensure my brother does not return.

966
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,069
Destroy everything.

967
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,110
Mom?

968
01:18:42,636 --> 01:18:44,228
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?

969
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:45,624
Call it in.

970
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,153
Yeah.

971
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:51,386
Base, we've got Xena,

972
01:18:51,505 --> 01:18:52,945
Jackie Chan and Robin Hood.

973
01:18:53,773 --> 01:18:55,428
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

974
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:59,496
But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

975
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:01,082
Not without hard evidence.

976
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,546
Found you!

977
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:10,951
My friends!

978
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:13,720
This is good!

979
01:19:14,034 --> 01:19:14,900
This is good.

980
01:19:15,014 --> 01:19:16,231
I don't believe it.

981
01:19:16,369 --> 01:19:17,548
Oh, excuse me.

982
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:19,504
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

983
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,087
My friends,

984
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:25,971
I've never been happier to see anyone.

985
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,055
But you should not have come.

986
01:19:30,264 --> 01:19:31,481
We're here to take you home.

987
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,779
You know I can't go home.

988
01:19:36,912 --> 01:19:37,880
My father is...

989
01:19:39,601 --> 01:19:40,778
dead because of me.

990
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,242
And I must remain in exile.

991
01:19:44,005 --> 01:19:44,578
Thor,

992
01:19:45,593 --> 01:19:47,423
your father still lives.

993
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,586
Tell me Loki,
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgarol?

994
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:09,004
You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?

995
01:20:09,234 --> 01:20:10,887
There are secret paths
between the worlds

996
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,540
to which even you, with all your gifts,
are blind.

997
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:16,822
But I have need of them no longer,
now that I am king.

998
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,756
And I say, for your act of treason,

999
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,658
you are relieved of your duties
as Gatekeeper,

1000
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,527
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

1001
01:20:23,923 --> 01:20:26,070
Then I need no longer obey you.

1002
01:20:47,227 --> 01:20:49,070
Get somebody from Linguistics
down here.

1003
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,893
Was somebody else coming?

1004
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,353
Is that one of Stark's?

1005
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,402
I don't know.

1006
01:21:25,685 --> 01:21:27,741
The guy never tells me anything.

1007
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:32,617
<i>Hello.</i>

1008
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,732
<i>You are using
unregistered weapons technology.</i>

1009
01:21:35,956 --> 01:21:37,238
<i>Identify yourself</i>

1010
01:21:41,057 --> 01:21:42,058
Here we go.

1011
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,489
Incoming!

1012
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,544
Jane, you have to leave.

1013
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,663
What are you gonna do?
I'm staying here.

1014
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,444
Thor's going to fight with us!

1015
01:21:59,993 --> 01:22:00,993
My friends,

1016
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:02,947
I'm just a man.

1017
01:22:03,397 --> 01:22:05,673
I'll only be in the way,
or worse get one of you killed.

1018
01:22:06,098 --> 01:22:07,961
But I can help
get these people to safety.

1019
01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:10,184
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

1020
01:22:10,727 --> 01:22:12,770
We'll need some time.
You'll have it!

1021
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,889
Ok, move it, people!

1022
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,706
Everybody out!

1023
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:18,078
Use the back door.

1024
01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:20,028
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

1025
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,026
Keep it distracted.

1026
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,642
For Asgard!

1027
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,003
Fall back!

1028
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,044
Go. Now. Run!

1029
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,510
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

1030
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:19,096
No. I will die a warrior's death.

1031
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,314
Stories will be told of this day.

1032
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:24,310
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

1033
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:28,050
Now go.

1034
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,510
You must return to Asgard.

1035
01:24:37,746 --> 01:24:39,109
You have to stop Loki.

1036
01:24:39,193 --> 01:24:40,326
What about you?

1037
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:42,730
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

1038
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:44,705
Come on.

1039
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,156
We need to fall back. Come on.

1040
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:52,509
Come on.

1041
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:01,334
Wait!

1042
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:10,651
What's he doing?

1043
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:38,736
Brother whatever...

1044
01:25:39,174 --> 01:25:40,966
I have done to wrong you,

1045
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:44,022
whatever I have done
to lead you to do this,

1046
01:25:45,004 --> 01:25:46,737
I am truly sorry.

1047
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:49,229
<i>But these people are innocent.</i>

1048
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,270
Taking their lives...

1049
01:25:52,646 --> 01:25:54,263
will gain you nothing.

1050
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,002
So take mine

1051
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:05,241
and end this.

1052
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:20,240
No.

1053
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:37,804
It's over.

1054
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,370
No. it's not over.

1055
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,336
I mean, you're safe.

1056
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:44,415
We're safe.

1057
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:46,918
It's over.

1058
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:53,920
No.

1059
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,562
No.

1060
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,677
We're spiking.
Levels increase!

1061
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,638
Whosoever holds this hammer,

1062
01:27:46,256 --> 01:27:47,413
if he be worthy,

1063
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:52,355
shall possess the power of Thor.

1064
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,084
Jane!

1065
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,200
No. No. No!
Come!

1066
01:28:14,201 --> 01:28:14,894
No!

1067
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,884
Oh. My. God.

1068
01:29:48,878 --> 01:29:50,385
So, is this how you normally look?

1069
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:52,035
More or less.

1070
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,519
It's a good look.

1071
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,736
We must go to the Bifrost site.

1072
01:29:56,876 --> 01:29:58,290
I would have words with my brother.

1073
01:29:58,292 --> 01:29:59,142
Excuse me!

1074
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,133
Donald?

1075
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,268
I don't think you've been
completely honest with me.

1076
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:08,464
Know this, Son of Coul.

1077
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,318
You and I, we fight for the same cause,

1078
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,617
the protection of this world.

1079
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:13,746
From this day forward,
you can count me as your ally

1080
01:30:13,957 --> 01:30:16,873
if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

1081
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:18,240
Stolen.
Borrowed.

1082
01:30:19,568 --> 01:30:21,232
Of course, you can have
your equipment back.

1083
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,609
You're gonna need it
to continue your research.

1084
01:30:24,581 --> 01:30:26,328
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

1085
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:28,735
Sure.

1086
01:30:31,149 --> 01:30:32,800
Wait, I need to debrief you!

1087
01:30:40,241 --> 01:30:41,458
Welcome to Asgard.

1088
01:31:07,102 --> 01:31:08,887
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

1089
01:31:17,095 --> 01:31:17,923
Heimdall?

1090
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:23,370
Heimdall!

1091
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:26,931
He doesn't answer.

1092
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:29,343
Then we are stranded.

1093
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:30,724
Heimdall!

1094
01:31:31,022 --> 01:31:32,788
If you can hear me, we need you now!

1095
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,934
Heimdall! We need you now!

1096
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:43,699
Heimdall!

1097
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:01,161
I must go back to Asgard,
but I give you my word,

1098
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:04,825
I will return for you.

1099
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:13,669
Deal?

1100
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,454
Deal.

1101
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:46,688
Get him to the healing room!

1102
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,161
Leave my brother to me.

1103
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:16,400
It's said

1104
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:21,684
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

1105
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,943
I hope it's true,

1106
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:28,885
so that you may know...

1107
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:31,936
your death came...

1108
01:33:32,532 --> 01:33:34,186
at the hand...

1109
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:36,492
of Laufey.

1110
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,002
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

1111
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:55,051
Loki!

1112
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:56,518
You saved him!

1113
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:02,880
I swear to you, Mother,

1114
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:06,094
that they will pay for what
they've done today.

1115
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:07,333
Loki.

1116
01:34:08,222 --> 01:34:08,940
Thor!

1117
01:34:10,285 --> 01:34:12,024
I knew you'd return to us.

1118
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,370
Why don't you tell her

1119
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:23,154
how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

1120
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,159
What?

1121
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,665
Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.

1122
01:34:27,127 --> 01:34:29,749
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.

1123
01:34:30,326 --> 01:34:31,578
It's good to have you back.

1124
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,404
Now if you'll excuse me,

1125
01:34:33,406 --> 01:34:35,116
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1126
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:18,429
You can't stop it.

1127
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,957
The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.

1128
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:44,868
Jane?

1129
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:48,326
Why have you done this?

1130
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:51,837
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

1131
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,066
When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.

1132
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:58,052
I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.

1133
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,465
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1134
01:36:00,754 --> 01:36:02,789
You can't kill an entire race!

1135
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:03,848
Why not?

1136
01:36:07,215 --> 01:36:10,305
And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?

1137
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,002
You...

1138
01:36:12,415 --> 01:36:14,600
could have killed them
all with your bare hands.

1139
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,696
I've changed.
So have I.

1140
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,641
Now fight me.

1141
01:36:23,032 --> 01:36:24,819
I never wanted the throne!

1142
01:36:26,254 --> 01:36:28,210
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1143
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,785
I will not fight you, Brother!

1144
01:36:30,789 --> 01:36:32,211
I'm not your brother.

1145
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,418
I never was.

1146
01:36:34,515 --> 01:36:36,095
Loki, this is madness.

1147
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:37,731
Is it madness?

1148
01:36:39,124 --> 01:36:40,031
Is it?

1149
01:36:41,733 --> 01:36:42,584
Is it?

1150
01:36:43,982 --> 01:36:47,377
Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?

1151
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:50,291
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1152
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,253
It was!

1153
01:36:54,888 --> 01:36:57,209
Well, maybe,
when we're finished here,

1154
01:36:57,351 --> 01:36:58,998
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1155
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:41,922
Thor!

1156
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:51,210
Brother, please.

1157
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:03,897
Enough!

1158
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:48,969
Look at you,

1159
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:52,862
the Mighty Thor,

1160
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:58,018
with all your strength,

1161
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,221
and what good does it do you now?

1162
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:04,381
Do you hear me, Brother?

1163
01:39:04,671 --> 01:39:06,406
There's nothing you can do!

1164
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,964
What are you doing?

1165
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,825
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

1166
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:41,959
Forgive me, Jane.

1167
01:40:20,903 --> 01:40:22,233
I could have done it, Father!

1168
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,334
I could have done it!

1169
01:40:26,306 --> 01:40:27,273
For you!

1170
01:40:28,342 --> 01:40:29,425
For all of us!

1171
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:32,831
No, Loki.

1172
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:42,912
Loki, no.

1173
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:45,886
No!

1174
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:51,566
No.

1175
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:09,025
It's gone.

1176
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:24,813
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1177
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:29,152
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1178
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:32,776
Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

1179
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,222
As a matter of fact,

1180
01:42:34,638 --> 01:42:38,588
falling was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

1181
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,640
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1182
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:02,854
How is he?

1183
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,216
He mourns for his brother.

1184
01:43:08,942 --> 01:43:09,651
And...

1185
01:43:11,366 --> 01:43:12,303
He misses her.

1186
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:14,910
The mortal.

1187
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:33,031
You'll be a wise king.

1188
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,814
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1189
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:42,801
Or a better father.

1190
01:43:54,253 --> 01:43:55,466
I have...

1191
01:43:55,983 --> 01:43:57,415
much to learn.

1192
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:00,620
I know that now.

1193
01:44:05,946 --> 01:44:07,313
Someday, perhaps,

1194
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:10,712
I shall make you proud.

1195
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,078
You've already made me proud.

1196
01:44:35,265 --> 01:44:36,808
So Earth is lost to us.

1197
01:44:38,525 --> 01:44:39,228
No.

1198
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,025
There is always hope.

1199
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:47,814
Can you see her?

1200
01:44:51,125 --> 01:44:51,872
Yes.

1201
01:44:56,076 --> 01:44:57,970
I have the particle detectors!

1202
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,219
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

1203
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:02,375
Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

1204
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:03,603
How is she?

1205
01:45:03,862 --> 01:45:04,652
In the car.

1206
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:06,110
Come on, Jane!

1207
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,168
She searches for you.

1208
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,026

<font color="#ffff80"><i>Sync & corrections April 2020</i></font>

1209
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,384
Dr. Selvig.

1210
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,748
So you're the man behind all this?

1211
01:53:27,324 --> 01:53:28,873
It's quite a labyrinth.

1212
01:53:29,886 --> 01:53:31,176
I was thinking...

1213
01:53:31,178 --> 01:53:33,526
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1214
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:43,676
I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.

1215
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:48,493
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1216
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:50,309
I have a lot to work with.

1217
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,503
The Foster Theory.

1218
01:53:52,739 --> 01:53:54,693
A gateway to another dimension.

1219
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:56,277
It's unprecedented.

1220
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,084
Isn't it?

1221
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:05,228
Legend tells us one thing,

1222
01:54:05,230 --> 01:54:06,701
history, another.

1223
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:11,047
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1224
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:20,187
What is it?

1225
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,509
Power, Doctor.

1226
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:23,789
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1227
01:54:24,358 --> 01:54:26,053
maybe unlimited power.

1228
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:33,577
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1229
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:37,507
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
