1
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:44,003
Oh, great and mighty Rapu,

2
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:48,091
we pray to you for water and sustenance.

3
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:53,596
I pray to you, not for me,
but for my daughter.

4
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,343
I'm tired.

5
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,595
<i>You have suffered.</i>

6
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,264
<i>Come to me.</i>

7
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,392
<i>Come to me.</i>

8
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,192
<i>You have suffered.</i>

9
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,281
<i>Come to me.</i>

10
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,878
<i>You have suffered.</i>

11
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:32,505
Ah! What do we have here?

12
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:35,758
Look at it.

13
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,635
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

14
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,473
Rapu.

15
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,228
Bringer of Light.

16
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,646
Oh, it's one of mine.

17
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,484
I am Gorr, the last of your disciples.

18
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,613
We have lost everything, my lord.

19
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,406
The land is dry.

20
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,742
All life is lost.

21
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,994
But our faith in you never wavered

22
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,163
and now we await the promise

23
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,708
of the eternal reward.

24
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,085
Is this why you celebrate?

25
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,465
He... He thinks there's an eternal reward.

26
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,471
No. No, sorry.

27
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,848
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

28
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,436
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

29
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,522
We just vanquished the holder
of the Necrosword...

30
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,066
<i>- You have suffered.</i>
- ...before he could harm

31
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,734
any other gods with that cursed blade.

32
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,235
<i>If it's revenge you seek.</i>

33
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,071
He threatened to end my entire empire.

34
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,239
But, my lord,

35
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,326
your empire has already ended.

36
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,828
There's no one left to worship you.

37
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,498
There'll be
more followers to replace you.

38
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:49,791
There always are.

39
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:51,751
We have suffered...

40
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,046
and we have starved.

41
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:59,884
My daughter died...

42
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,721
- in your name.
- And well you should.

43
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:06,849
Suffering for your gods
is your only purpose.

44
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,227
There's nothing for you after death.

45
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:10,770
Except death.

46
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,315
You are no god.

47
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,490
I renounce you.

48
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:32,709
Now your meaningless life
finally does have a purpose.

49
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,379
To sacrifice yourself to me.

50
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,884
<i>If it's revenge you seek...</i>

51
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,053
..<i>. kill all the gods.</i>

52
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,097
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

53
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:49,225
<i>If it's revenge you seek...</i>

54
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,186
<i>summon the Bifrost.</i>

55
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,771
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

56
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,606
<i>Kill all the gods.</i>

57
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,983
<i>Summon the Bifrost.</i>

58
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,235
<i>- Go to Eternity.</i>
<i>- Kill all the gods.</i>

59
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,571
<i>Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods.</i>

60
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,753
The sword chose you.

61
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,589
You are now cursed!

62
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:20,840
Funny.

63
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,092
It doesn't feel like a curse.

64
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,306
Feels like a promise.

65
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,392
So, this is my vow.

66
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,481
All gods will die.

67
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,320
Come, come, gather round.

68
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,698
And listen to the legend
of the Space Viking.

69
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:33,579
AKA the God of Thunder.
AKA Thor Odinson.

70
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:42,213
<i>Raised in the way of the warrior,</i>

71
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,799
<i>Thor was taught to help win battles,</i>

72
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,425
<i>fighting the good fight</i>

73
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,302
<i>for those who can't fight good.</i>

74
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:54,433
<i>He grew and he grew and he grew.</i>

75
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,311
<i>He was sensitive, like a smile.</i>

76
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:00,773
<i>And his loving nature</i>
<i>did not discriminate.</i>

77
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,985
<i>He once loved</i>
<i>a swashbuckling Passionista.</i>

78
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,988
<i>Another time, he loved a Wolf Woman</i>

79
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,573
<i>on a Woman Wolf.</i>

80
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,494
<i>But Thor's one true love</i>
<i>was an Earth woman</i>

81
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,246
<i>named Jane Fonda.</i>

82
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,790
<i>Oh, wait. No. Jane Foster.</i>

83
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:21,627
<i>But sadly, in the battle</i>
<i>for love, Thor lost.</i>

84
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,503
<i>Ooh.</i>

85
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,424
<i>In fact, he lost a lot</i>
<i>of people in those days.</i>

86
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:27,675
<i>His mum.</i>

87
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,468
<i>His dad.</i>

88
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:30,386
<i>And that guy.</i>

89
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,637
<i>And that guy.</i>

90
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,055
<i>And whoever that is.</i>

91
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,265
<i>And Heimdall.</i>

92
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:36,184
<i>And his brother.</i>

93
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,935
<i>And his brother, again.</i>

94
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,020
<i>And again.</i>

95
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,274
<i>Poor Thor had to watch</i>
<i>his planet explode.</i>

96
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:46,194
<i>And then he said, "What have I done?"</i>

97
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,237
<i>It seemed that everything</i>

98
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,239
<i>and everyone he loved, he lost.</i>

99
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,284
<i>And so he hid his heart</i>
<i>behind a big, fleshy bod,</i>

100
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,870
<i>so it could never be broken again.</i>

101
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,247
<i>But just because he was done loving,</i>

102
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,957
<i>didn't mean he was done fighting.</i>

103
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,711
<i>He teamed up with</i>
<i>the Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

104
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:06,297
<i>and set off on some</i>
<i>classic Thor adventures.</i>

105
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,716
<i>He got in shape.</i>

106
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,301
<i>Putting in the hard yards.</i>

107
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:14,472
<i>Turning pains into gains,</i>
<i>and never skipping leg day.</i>

108
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:18,893
<i>He went from Dad Bod to God Bod.</i>

109
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,271
<i>But beneath his God Bod,</i>
<i>there was still a Sad Bod</i>

110
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:23,522
<i>just trying to get out.</i>

111
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,276
<i>Because all of the bods</i>

112
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,445
<i>that Thor had worn over the years</i>

113
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,738
<i>couldn't hide the pain</i>

114
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,698
<i>that he was feeling on the inside.</i>

115
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,452
<i>So he gave up his search for love,</i>

116
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,331
<i>accepting that he was</i>
<i>only good for one thing...</i>

117
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,752
<i>Waiting in quiet contemplation</i>
<i>for someone to say,</i>

118
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:48,506
<i>"Thor, we need your help</i>
<i>to win this battle."</i>

119
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,300
Thor.

120
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,344
We need your help to win this battle.

121
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,720
Let's go.

122
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,889
Okay. Come on, Stormbreaker.

123
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:58,975
Back to work.

124
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,602
We must hurry, okay?

125
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,063
People are dying.

126
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,273
See you down there.

127
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:10,820
Hurry up!

128
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,000
Give me those. You're gonna break 'em.

129
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,377
I am Groot!

130
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,129
Ah, you got sap all over it.

131
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,882
Hello, everybody.

132
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,718
Well, well, look who it is.

133
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,261
How are we doing, guys?

134
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,554
Terrible!

135
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,639
We're all about to die.

136
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,183
You said this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

137
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:44,228
I said it was going to be,
"Like a relaxing holiday."

138
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,105
But look at that resplendent skyscape.

139
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,523
Three suns of Saturn.

140
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,150
What could be more relaxing than that?

141
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,319
An actual holiday!

142
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,571
Die, Booskan scum!

143
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,658
God of Thunder.

144
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,201
King Yakan.

145
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,787
You have finally joined our fight.

146
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,080
Well, as they say,

147
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:04,582
"Better late than not at all."

148
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,375
Yes, it's very nice.

149
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,587
As you know, we used to live
in a peaceful oasis.

150
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,672
But then our gods were murdered.

151
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:12,715
Murdered?

152
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,926
And now our sacred temple
has been left unguarded,

153
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,721
and Habooska's hordes
took control of its power.

154
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,350
It is our most sacred shrine
and he desecrates it.

155
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,434
Not for long.

156
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,686
Ah!

157
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,065
King Yakan, tell them
what happened here today.

158
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,567
Tell of the time that Thor,

159
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:36,405
and his ragtag, motley crew
of misfit desperados,

160
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,532
turned the tide of the battle,

161
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,785
and etched their names in history.

162
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,745
For the odds may be against us,

163
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,163
but I'll tell you this for free...

164
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,331
Here it comes.

165
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,918
This ends here and now!

166
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,923
Oh!

167
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,285
He's not going to go
into the temple, is he? No.

168
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:50,664
Oh.

169
00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:59,340
Well done, everybody.

170
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,217
We can collectively take credit for that

171
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,676
because we worked as a team.

172
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,929
We used our hearts and our minds

173
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,347
to defeat the enemy

174
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:08,307
with minimal loss or damage.

175
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,942
What a classic Thor adventure!

176
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,360
Hurrah!

177
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,385
Good book?

178
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:45,594
Yeah.

179
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,429
I wrote it.

180
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,058
Wait. You're Dr Jane Foster?

181
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,393
I am.

182
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,228
- Uh... Hi.
- Hi.

183
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,896
How's the, uh, Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

184
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,481
It's tough.

185
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,941
- Yeah.
- Really tough.

186
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,776
It's... You need a 3D model.

187
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,361
You ever see <i>Event Horizon?</i>

188
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,821
No.

189
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,240
<i>- Interstellar?</i>
- No.

190
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,200
That movie explains everything
really clearly.

191
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,703
Um, all right. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge

192
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:14,498
folds space, so that point A and point B

193
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,418
coexist in space and time.

194
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,086
Like that.

195
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,256
You just ruined your own book.

196
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,091
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

197
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,845
Watch those movies.

198
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,471
- Okay.
- Okay.

199
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,807
Saw the Hot Cheetos, had to get it.

200
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,025
So, how's, uh... how's it going?

201
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,445
It's going amazing.

202
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,494
Have you told anyone else besides me?

203
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,414
When people find out,
they start acting weird.

204
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,499
They're just different.

205
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,127
I don't need that in my life right now.

206
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,879
Anyway, it's not that serious.

207
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,672
Jane, it's Stage Four.

208
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,883
Out of, like, how many stages?

209
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,635
Four.

210
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,969
That we know about.

211
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,643
Oh, you have somewhere else
you gotta be right now

212
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,394
that's more important than chemo?

213
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:18,854
No.

214
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,072
You're trying to get back
to the lab, aren't you?

215
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,865
I have a few ideas I'm trying.

216
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,867
Okay, no, time out.

217
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,870
I know you think your lab work
is something you have to do,

218
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,623
otherwise you're letting down
all of civilisation,

219
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,334
but you're not getting what the universe

220
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,044
is actually trying to tell you,

221
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,504
so let me translate.

222
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,090
Slow down.

223
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,217
You need your energy
to fight this thing.

224
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,970
I'll fight it my way, okay?

225
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,347
Well, FYI,

226
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,184
"my way" does not have
to equal "alone in a lab."

227
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,147
Maybe it's time to play
the Space Viking card.

228
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,358
- It's not a card.
- Yes, it is.

229
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,901
- There's no card.
- There's a card.

230
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,445
It's tall, it's blond,
and it's gorgeous.

231
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,988
It's a handsome card.

232
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,032
- Jane, are you sure?
- Look, Darcy...

233
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,244
I will figure this out by myself.

234
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,921
<i>Results are</i>
<i>still coming back the same.</i>

235
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,424
<i>I'm afraid the chemo</i>
<i>has very little effect.</i>

236
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,219
<i>I'm so sorry, Jane.</i>

237
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,805
<i>If there's anything I can do,</i>

238
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,807
<i>or if you just wanna talk, call me.</i>

239
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,615
Smell like a king,
because you're worthy.

240
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,158
Old Spice.

241
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,078
Cut!

242
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,691
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

243
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,026
Home.

244
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,361
Yes, home, Father.

245
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,530
We're here to take you home.

246
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,407
Yes. To planet Asgard.

247
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,952
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

248
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,496
It is people. It is you!

249
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,873
And now, it is time

250
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:27,584
for me to pass on to the spirit realm.

251
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,047
I will take my place

252
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:35,092
in the great banqueting hall
of Valhalla,

253
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,678
the resting place of the gods.

254
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,721
Oh, one more thing.

255
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,849
You have a sister.

256
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,145
And so now, I turn into godly stardust,

257
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,981
and say farewell.

258
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,691
Oh, look.

259
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,193
Do you see? It's happening.

260
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,612
I'm disappearing.

261
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,702
No!

262
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,786
Father!

263
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,415
But wait! Brother!

264
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,044
An ominous portal
hath appeared behind us.

265
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,754
Transform!

266
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:25,350
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

267
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,561
Now, I return to Asgard

268
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,480
to stake my claim
as the rightful heir to the throne,

269
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,399
and no one will stop me!

270
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,442
Join me or die!

271
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,860
We will never join you, witch!

272
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,903
Mjolnir!

273
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,075
Impossible!

274
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,454
I broke your hammer!

275
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,080
Time to die!

276
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,540
Bifrost!

277
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,846
You can almost feel the power

278
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,766
of these magnificent
and immovable stones.

279
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,685
Okay. Let's head back to the village

280
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,855
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

281
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,482
Come on.

282
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,060
God of Disaster,

283
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,437
we thank you.

284
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,481
We feared we would be at war forever

285
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,358
without the protection of our gods,

286
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,486
but now, peace shall reign.

287
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,448
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

288
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,327
As is tradition,
the protectors of our world

289
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,496
are bestowed with great beasts.

290
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,125
Giant goats!

291
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,210
Oh, look at those! They are wonderful.

292
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,171
Korg, look at that.
Those things are beautiful.

293
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,716
King Yakan, thank you so much.

294
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,634
Listen, um, about the temple...

295
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:23,844
I don't wanna talk about the temple.

296
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,012
I know, but if we were to talk about it,

297
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,346
- I think it's important...
- It's making me sad.

298
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,431
...to life and material objects...

299
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,807
- And mad.
- Okay, I'll stop talking.

300
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,600
Don't forget the goats.

301
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,061
Which you accepted,
and now must take with you.

302
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,354
No backsies.

303
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,233
- Aw. They are beautiful.
- Yes, they are beautiful.

304
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,944
They also scream quite a lot.

305
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:41,987
They'll be fine.

306
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,072
I am Groot.

307
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,198
We need to find the damn remote

308
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,950
so we can download the distress signal!

309
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,077
Retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

310
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,495
One of your goats probably ate it!

311
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,330
Goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

312
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,832
Well, I ain't digging through
their crap.

313
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,625
I love them!

314
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,710
They should live with us forever!

315
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:57,919
Found the remote!

316
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,129
I'm putting them down.

317
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,297
- Me too.
- Is it working or not?

318
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,673
No, it's not workin'. It's not charged.

319
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:02,758
Well, maybe you need to find a charger...

320
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:03,884
Get out of my way!

321
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,177
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

322
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,012
Whew.

323
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,889
- Korg, you okay?
- Yeah, bro. All good.

324
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,182
All right. Everybody, just relax.

325
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,433
The goats are gonna be fine.

326
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,185
If not, we can just use them for meat...

327
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,730
...ting people. Meeting people.

328
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,231
They're a great conversation starter.

329
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,776
And I've been told you can summon them
with a special whistle

330
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,444
that goes something like this...

331
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,321
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

332
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,822
No, that's not it. You have a go.

333
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,324
No, that's not it.

334
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,284
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Kraglin!

335
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,410
No, that's not it.

336
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,746
- You been here this whole time?
- Yeah, you said to stay with the ship.

337
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,165
This is Glenda. We're married.

338
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,334
I am Groot.

339
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,418
What did we tell you

340
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,003
about jumpin' into new relationships?

341
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,421
That I shouldn't be doing that.

342
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,589
Yeah, you can't get married

343
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,132
on every single planet we land on.

344
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,801
I am Groot.

345
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,803
Finally!

346
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,763
All right, here we go. Distress calls.

347
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,100
<i>Please help us!</i>
<i>The God Butcher has found us!</i>

348
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,434
God Butcher?

349
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,186
<i>He left them</i>
<i>hanging as a warning.</i>

350
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,146
Look at all of these gods, murdered.

351
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,107
<i>Our greatest champions,</i>

352
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,025
<i>now laid to waste.</i>

353
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,235
The horror.

354
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,778
Who could have done something like this?

355
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,030
<i>Thor, where are you?</i>

356
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,698
Wait, wait, wait.
What was that? Go back.

357
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,201
Play that one.

358
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,287
<i>- Thor, where are you?</i>
- Sif?

359
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,622
<i>We need you here.</i>

360
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,333
My friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

361
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,793
Start the ship, my friends.

362
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,878
I don't know, maybe we should split up.

363
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:22,963
So many people to save,

364
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,048
I mean, look at all of these distress...

365
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,633
...calls.

366
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,012
Thor.

367
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,514
You gonna be okay?

368
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,141
I admire your commitment to each other.

369
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,350
It's a beautiful thing.

370
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,227
Alas, it's something I'll never have.

371
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,770
Buddy, if I may...

372
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:40,397
You may.

373
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,150
After thousands of years of living,

374
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,442
you don't seem to know
who the hell you are.

375
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,903
I've been lost before.

376
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,614
But then I found meaning, I found love.

377
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:51,950
And yeah, it got taken from me,

378
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,160
and god, that hurts.

379
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,706
But that shitty feeling
is better than feeling empty.

380
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,250
My hope for you is that

381
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,878
one day, you will find something

382
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,505
to make you feel this shitty.

383
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,508
I have loved before. It didn't work out.

384
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,677
They either die a grismal death

385
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,429
or they dump you
with a handwritten letter.

386
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:13,513
I don't know which is worse,

387
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,765
but it's why I keep everyone
at arm's length.

388
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,686
You've grown too attached.

389
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:20,937
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

390
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,898
You must go. I'll find Sif.

391
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,858
You answer the other calls.

392
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,318
The galaxy needs its Guardians.

393
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,402
Cool, yeah. We were just leaving...

394
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,904
Shh. I know it hurts.

395
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,739
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

396
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,366
To ease the pain, why don't you, uh,

397
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,870
take this ship here
as a parting farewell gift?

398
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,955
Oh, you're giving me my ship?

399
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,332
Yes, she's yours.

400
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:43,210
May you make as many memories
with her as I have.

401
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,878
She's a temperamental old lass.

402
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,422
Will serve you well in a tight pickle.

403
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,715
- I'll start the ship.
- Thank you.

404
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,091
Goodbye, old friend.

405
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,011
A human handshake

406
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,971
to the Asgardian shake.

407
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,599
Into the snake that you cannot trust.

408
00:25:58,767 --> 00:25:59,893
You're really dragging this out.

409
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,812
And finish with the classic
Asgardian high one.

410
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:07,943
Let's go.

411
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,110
Take care of my crew.

412
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,278
This is gonna be hard for them.

413
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,571
Hurry up!

414
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:12,739
Not her.

415
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,157
Remember what I told you.

416
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,576
You ever feel lost,

417
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,663
just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

418
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,123
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

419
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,462
All right. Bye.

420
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,468
For what it's worth,
let's cling to the good memories.

421
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,303
We Asgardians say,

422
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,973
"May you travel with the speed
of Odin's ravens.

423
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,599
"I'll see you in Valhalla

424
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,518
"where we shall drink mead and..."

425
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,689
- They're gone.
- Alone again. Just me and you.

426
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,023
Stormbreaker!

427
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,985
Watch out, you frickin' crazy axe!

428
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:54,823
So what do we do now, bro?

429
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,324
Let's go get Sif!

430
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,717
Who or what is that?

431
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:17,012
Falligar, God of the Falligarians.

432
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,514
One of the nicest gods you'll ever meet.

433
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,225
Oh, no.

434
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,986
Sif, it's me, Thor.

435
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,529
Odinson?

436
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,114
You're missing an arm.

437
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,449
I'm gonna get you home.

438
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,659
No! Leave me here.

439
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,703
I want to die a warrior's death.

440
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,913
On the battlefield. In battle.

441
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,958
And then I can claim my place
in Valhalla.

442
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,502
Oh, I hate to break it to you,

443
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,087
but for a warrior to get into Valhalla,

444
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,547
you have to die in the battle.

445
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,258
- You survived.
- Oh, shit.

446
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,635
Maybe your arm is in Valhalla.

447
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,555
What happened here?

448
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,640
I've been hunting a madman.

449
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,851
I followed him here, but it was a trap.

450
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,019
Who is this madman?

451
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,813
The God Butcher is coming.

452
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,316
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

453
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,360
Asgard is next.

454
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:04,888
Look, it's Thor!

455
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,931
- Thor!
- Take Sif to the infirmary.

456
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,183
Hey!

457
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,476
Who'd you piss off now?

458
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,060
This is not my fault.
I've never even seen these things,

459
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,145
whatever the hell they are.

460
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,438
Welcome back.

461
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:39,964
Who's the new guy?

462
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,842
That guy? You're gonna love that guy.

463
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:59,609
Mjol... Mjolnir! Mjolnir!

464
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:00,818
It's me, Thor.

465
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,153
Have you seen my hammer?

466
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,780
Mjolnir, here, boy.

467
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,283
Mjolnir?

468
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:12,622
Mjolnir.

469
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,837
You're back!

470
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,384
Mjolnir!

471
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,413
Excuse me.

472
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,248
Hello. That's my hammer
you've got there.

473
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,084
And that's my look.

474
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:06,884
Hey!

475
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,346
Enough tomfoolery.

476
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,682
Why don't you take off
that mask and reveal yourself?

477
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,850
Come on.

478
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:16,769
Hey.

479
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:18,813
Jane?

480
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,155
<i>Let me tell you</i>
<i>the legend of Thor and Jane.</i>

481
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:32,994
<i>He was a God of Thunder</i>
<i>and she, a woman of science.</i>

482
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:36,581
<i>And although they were</i>
<i>from different worlds,</i>

483
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,460
<i>somehow, it just made sense.</i>

484
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:41,377
Whoo! Ha-ha!

485
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:42,879
<i>And together they embarked</i>

486
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,881
<i>on a journey of love.</i>

487
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,889
<i>Thor taught Jane the way of the warrior...</i>

488
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:58,061
<i>And Jane taught Thor</i>
<i>the way of the people.</i>

489
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:00,938
<i>And as time passed,</i>

490
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:03,650
<i>their love grew deeper and deeper.</i>

491
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,780
She's incredible, isn't she, Mjolnir?

492
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:14,744
I need you to promise me
you'll always protect her.

493
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,373
I love you too, buddy.

494
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,544
<i>And love that deep</i>
<i>has a way of becoming magical.</i>

495
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,759
<i>Thor set his sights toward a future</i>

496
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,969
<i>and all it might hold.</i>

497
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,850
<i>But the more he pondered</i>
<i>a life with Jane,</i>

498
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,977
<i>the more he feared losing that life.</i>

499
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,814
<i>And although</i>
<i>Jane didn't want to admit it,</i>

500
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,316
<i>she was scared of loss as well.</i>

501
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,030
<i>And so, they built walls between them.</i>

502
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,991
<i>Thor got busy saving humanity.</i>

503
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:55,785
Heimdall!

504
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,831
<i>And Jane got busy doing the same.</i>

505
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,708
<i>Real busy.</i>

506
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,752
<i>And eventually, the space</i>
<i>between them grew and grew</i>

507
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:06,921
<i>until it became too wide to bear.</i>

508
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,345
<i>Something had to give.</i>

509
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,974
I have to stay up all night
to go through this data. Okay?

510
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,183
And I have to stay up all night

511
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,436
- and clean all of this up.
- There's two plates!

512
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,520
It's two plates and two forks!

513
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:28,901
<i>And then, one night, it did give.</i>

514
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,155
<i>Jane wrote a note.</i>

515
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,408
<i>And Thor read that note.</i>

516
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:39,829
<i>And their legend suddenly became myth.</i>

517
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,249
<i>Or so they thought.</i>

518
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,837
You okay?

519
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,882
Yeah...
it's a little, uh, hot in...

520
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:53,009
Startin' to feel...

521
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,053
It's claustrophobic with the helmet.

522
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:01,309
How?

523
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:02,810
Uh...

524
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:05,730
Can we talk about this later?

525
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,356
Yeah, sure.

526
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,775
Great seeing you.

527
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:11,527
What?

528
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,161
<i>Kill all the gods.</i>

529
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:00,618
Hey. Is that the Necrosword?

530
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,037
That's cool. I've only ever
read about it in stories.

531
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,123
Then you know this is going to hurt.

532
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,917
Pain.

533
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,461
What is pain but a construct
invented by the weak?

534
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:11,838
Okay, that's very sharp!

535
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,139
Ready?

536
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,060
Don't touch my things.

537
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,881
Yeah, you better run, you coward.

538
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,402
The children.
They're taking the children!

539
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,154
Mommy!

540
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,407
Mom!

541
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:47,642
Shadow monsters. Disgusting.

542
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:53,564
Flew around the world twice. Nothing.

543
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:56,901
- Cowards must have run away.
- We'll find them.

544
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,530
- Quite a reunion, huh?
- Eh, you're telling me.

545
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,532
What's it been? Like, three, four years?

546
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,952
Eight years, seven months, and six days.

547
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,370
I haven't forgotten

548
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,704
the last time I saw you,

549
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,539
or didn't see you, because you left.

550
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,416
It's kind of an oversimplification

551
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,584
to say that I left.

552
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:15,920
Ah, no, you left. You did.

553
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,922
You wrote me a beautiful
handwritten letter.

554
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:20,049
I should know, I was there.

555
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,300
- You weren't there...
- I was.

556
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,760
...actually, hence the note.

557
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,222
And if you weren't
there to see me leave,

558
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,057
then maybe it was you that left.

559
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,768
- Fair point. Hmm.
- Uh...

560
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,311
Not that it matters.

561
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:33,562
Like, who's keeping track, right?

562
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,106
No, yeah.

563
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,608
I suppose we both left
and both got left.

564
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:38,818
Now you're leaving again.

565
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,154
Miek, we need detailed accounts

566
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,322
from all the witnesses.

567
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:44,490
Darryl, get me all the names

568
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:45,616
of the children who have been lost.

569
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,702
Your Majesty,
my daughter has been taken,

570
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:48,786
and I don't know where she is.

571
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,246
And she'll be found.

572
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,789
Guys, they're bleeding.

573
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,290
Get them to the infirmary. Now!

574
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,375
Darryl!

575
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,460
Majesty, should we start working

576
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:58,337
on a performance of this entire debacle?

577
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,089
The people need entertainment.

578
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,841
Particularly now, in times of crisis.

579
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:03,509
Particularly.

580
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:06,762
I did not hear a, "No."

581
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:08,431
Nor did I.

582
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:09,724
- Asgard. Night.
- Yes!

583
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,100
We open on some sleeping children.

584
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,690
So, that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

585
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,150
The old ex-girlfriend.

586
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,359
Jodie Foster.

587
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:21,569
Jane Foster.

588
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:22,862
The one that got away.

589
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:24,613
The one that got away.

590
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:25,740
That means escaped.

591
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:27,491
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah.

592
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,785
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend

593
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,454
and your ex-hammer hangin' out,

594
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:32,913
and getting on so well.

595
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,461
What you up to, bro?

596
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,463
Come on.

597
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,256
Come to daddy.

598
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:45,259
Come on. Mjolnir.

599
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:49,638
Hey! There you are.

600
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:50,765
Hey.

601
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:51,891
Do you know
what I think we should do?

602
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,684
- I was just calling you.
- Start an army!

603
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:55,686
With what? Half our soldiers are dead!

604
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,354
Half our soldiers are always dead!

605
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,482
- Where are the children?
- Everyone, please go home.

606
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:00,566
I promise you we'll have news soon.

607
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,068
Someone needs to tell us what happened.

608
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,736
We shall find them.

609
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:07,073
- I just don't understand.
- You know what?

610
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,449
This is all our fault.

611
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,742
Stop it!

612
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:10,910
Asgard!

613
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,797
My friends, we must not quarrel.

614
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:26,550
In times like this, we need
to unite, come together.

615
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:28,761
I see what's happening here.

616
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,639
You're afraid. Hmm?

617
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,307
Scared.

618
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,643
Afraid.

619
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:36,936
Anxious.

620
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:39,814
If we are to find the children,

621
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:43,025
we must first look within ourselves.

622
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,902
I'm sorry. Miek, it's very hard

623
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,446
to give a rousing speech
with the noise.

624
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,073
- What are you doing?
- She's taking minutes.

625
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,491
Oh, precious minutes we don't have.

626
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,576
You want the kids back?

627
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,329
I'll be back in a minute.

628
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:57,581
You can write that down, Miek.

629
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:01,252
No!

630
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,012
Stormbreaker, what are you doing?

631
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,597
Is this about Mjolnir?

632
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:15,182
Everyone, out!

633
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,936
Didn't find them.

634
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,146
Oh, bae, your cape's on fire.

635
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,272
It's fine. It'll grow back.

636
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:22,773
I'm invoicing you for this.

637
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:23,858
Listen.

638
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,025
What do we know about this guy?

639
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:26,485
He travels through shadows.

640
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:28,070
And he creates monsters with them.

641
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:29,655
Absolutely freaky monsters.

642
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,824
He also wields the Necrosword.
How do I know that?

643
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,367
Because he almost speared me
in the face with it.

644
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,368
What's a Necrosword?

645
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,870
It's an ancient weapon
that's been passed

646
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,454
through hands since the dawn of time.

647
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,790
It has the ability to slay gods,

648
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,417
but it slowly corrupts and kills

649
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,002
whoever wields it, which means...

650
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,587
Oh, so, it infected him.

651
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,380
It's infecting him. Yes. It must be.

652
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,966
So basically,
we're up against a cursed,

653
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,801
shadow-zombie kidnapper.

654
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:52,678
Awesome. When do we leave?

655
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,138
Thor.

656
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:55,723
Can you see me?

657
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,057
Uh, floating head alert.

658
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:58,976
It's Astrid. Heimdall's son.

659
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,853
Astrid, are you okay?

660
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,938
I no longer go by the name Astrid.

661
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,065
I'm now known as Axl.

662
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:07,443
He's a singer from a popular band
I heard on Earth.

663
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:08,777
- G N' R.
- Astrid,

664
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,863
your father gave you
a very tough Viking name

665
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,531
and I intend to honour his wishes.

666
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:13,699
- Axl.
- Astrid.

667
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:14,992
- I said Axl.
- Astrid.

668
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,286
- Axl!
- It's asshole. Now listen to him!

669
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,955
All right, fine, Axl. Where are you?

670
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:23,375
I'm not sure. I don't know
how to use my magic eyes yet.

671
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:24,877
Your father taught me
and I'm gonna teach you.

672
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,463
I need you to focus
and hold out your hand.

673
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:30,090
Okay, good. Now focus.

674
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,383
Close your eyes.

675
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,390
Thor!

676
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:41,769
Hey, how's it going, kids?

677
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,687
"How's it going"? Look where we are.

678
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:45,731
We're in a cage made of spikes.

679
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:48,067
Yes, right. Not good. Yeah.

680
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,318
Are you gonna do something?

681
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,070
Yes. Yes, I am, but just not right now.

682
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:53,155
I'm the vision ghost. Look.

683
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:56,200
- See?
- What will happen to us?

684
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:57,826
Who can tell?

685
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,954
I mean, this is a very,
very bad situation.

686
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,539
You know, the good news
is you're Asgardians.

687
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,833
So, if you die,
you'll end up in Valhalla.

688
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,085
Oh, my God. Go away.

689
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:07,962
Wait, wait. Listen.

690
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,881
Okay. It's all right, children.

691
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:12,383
Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

692
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:13,884
Listen, I've got a plan, okay?

693
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:15,970
I'm putting together
a really, really good team.

694
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:19,640
We've got, um, Uncle Korg,
uh, King Valkyrie,

695
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:21,850
um, my ex-girlfriend, Jane,

696
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:24,144
which is a whole other story
I won't bore you with, okay?

697
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,522
But it is a top-notch team,

698
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,399
and we're gonna have you home
before you know it.

699
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:29,733
Yeah.

700
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:38,158
I know where you are.

701
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,538
I'm gonna get you out of here.

702
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:43,831
I'm scared.

703
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:46,125
We all are.

704
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,294
Thor! Thor! Save us.

705
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:53,299
Get me out of here. You take care, okay?

706
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,175
Take care. I'll see you soon. All right?

707
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:56,510
Axl, get me out of here!

708
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:59,096
They're in the Shadow Realm.

709
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,264
How do you know?

710
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:02,975
The heavy atmosphere there
has a darkness like no other.

711
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:05,102
It's as if colour fears to tread.
It's unmistakable.

712
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,604
Well then, if it's colour we need,

713
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,565
let's bring the rainbow.

714
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,444
"Bring the rainbow"?
Is that a catchphrase or something?

715
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,154
She's only been a Thor for a minute.

716
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:16,655
I mean, saving lives,
she's quite good at.

717
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:17,865
But the rest of it, she needs work.

718
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:18,949
How many catchphrases have there been?

719
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:19,992
A lot.

720
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,579
Yep. Jumped the gun.

721
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:24,997
Hang on, he moves through shadows

722
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,290
and he's going to the Shadow Realm,

723
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:27,374
it seems like that's where

724
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,417
he's going to be the most powerful.

725
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,543
You're right. We can't just go

726
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:30,669
marching in there. It could be a trap.

727
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:31,795
We'd be endangering the children.

728
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:33,088
- Mm.
- We need reinforcements.

729
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:34,173
We must raise an army.

730
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:35,549
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

731
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:36,967
- I'm thinking it.
- What are we thinking?

732
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:38,385
- Thinking what?
- I'm thinking it too.

733
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:40,763
- Omnipotence City.
- Hmm!

734
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,681
What's Omnipotence City?

735
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,892
It's the home of the most
powerful gods in the universe.

736
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,894
We could pull together
the greatest team ever.

737
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:49,229
We could recruit Ra, Hercules,

738
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:50,606
Tumatauenga

739
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,107
Quetzalcoatl, maybe.

740
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:54,443
And Zeus, the oldest
and wisest of them all.

741
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,528
- Did you say Zeus?
- Yeah, Zeus.

742
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:58,238
Like, the Zeus. Zeus-Zeus?

743
00:44:58,322 --> 00:44:59,656
I'm not sure if he has a second name.

744
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,949
Do you think my god will be there,

745
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:02,034
Ninny of the Nonny?

746
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,118
Oh, you never know, Korg.

747
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:04,161
But if they are,
we'll ask them to join our team.

748
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,287
Yes.

749
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,122
Stormbreaker.

750
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:08,999
All right. Calm down. Relax.

751
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,376
No, no, no, mate, we are not travelling

752
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:12,002
in Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

753
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:13,087
Look what just happened.

754
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,671
We can't exactly go
in your tiny, little,

755
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,465
flying portal horse, can we?
We won't all fit.

756
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:18,050
What are you talking about?
Warsong's awesome.

757
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,343
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

758
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:20,803
Stormbreaker just needs a conduit.

759
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,221
Anything that can handle space travel.

760
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:23,639
I love it when she talks shop.

761
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:25,140
It has the power to get us there,

762
00:45:25,224 --> 00:45:26,683
it just needs something
to focus that energy

763
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,852
so it's not so unpredictable.

764
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:30,896
You know, if we had a ship,
we could harness it

765
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,564
and use Stormbreaker as a power source.

766
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:34,483
- Oh, like an engine.
- Like an engine.

767
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:35,692
You need a ship?

768
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:36,944
I've got a ship.

769
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:43,117
Get rid of all those seats.

770
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,327
And you guys,
go tie those goats to the front.

771
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:46,829
We leave in 15 minutes.

772
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,831
Essentials only, everyone.

773
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:50,791
That's essential. Mm-hmm.

774
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,126
Fifteen minutes to departure!

775
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,503
Well, you moved on quick,
didn't you?

776
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:57,089
You're some piece of work.

777
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,426
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

778
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,177
Just catching up with an old friend.

779
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:03,303
Yeah.

780
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:05,097
I've been meaning to apologise.

781
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:06,932
Sorta acting a little weird before.

782
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:08,559
I just haven't really
been myself lately.

783
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:10,185
You know, kind of...

784
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:11,562
Trying to figure out who I am,

785
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,355
and, uh, just felt a little bit lost.

786
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:16,191
And then, all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me

787
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:17,651
and it was kind of...

788
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,153
It's a lot for me, too.

789
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:22,489
So, how did you guys get together?
How did this happen?

790
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:26,285
I swear I heard Mjolnir call to me.

791
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:27,870
Ah! Did it?

792
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,705
And so I came here to investigate,

793
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,541
and its pieces started glowing
and swirling,

794
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:33,792
- and then...
- Crazy.

795
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:35,377
- ...Thor.
- Ah.

796
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:36,753
Well, you know what,

797
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:39,006
it looks good on you, it works, so...

798
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,968
Whew.

799
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,052
Just checking.

800
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,099
See you later.

801
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:51,393
Five minutes to departure!

802
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:56,690
What?

803
00:46:57,149 --> 00:46:58,692
We were just talking.

804
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:11,955
<i>Mommy, don't leave me.</i>

805
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,999
Don't be afraid.

806
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:17,085
<i>Even when I'm gone, honey...</i>

807
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:20,672
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

808
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:25,344
<i>And whatever happens...</i>

809
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,931
<i>never stop fighting.</i>

810
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:31,308
<i>Never stop fighting.</i>

811
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:47,157
Hey. You all right?

812
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:49,034
- Great.
- Mm.

813
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:51,453
The sink would say otherwise.

814
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,873
You think I really should be coming?

815
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:56,500
I'm not getting any better.

816
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,335
You're a Thor.
Of course, you should come.

817
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:00,212
Besides, what else are you gonna do?

818
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:01,588
You're a Viking now.

819
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:03,840
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle,

820
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:06,093
and it needs to be
devastatingly painful.

821
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,636
Otherwise, you don't get into Valhalla.

822
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,971
That's my plan.

823
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:11,848
What about, you know, kinging and stuff?

824
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:14,476
I love being king. I love my people,

825
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,144
but it's all meetings and raven-mail,

826
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:17,854
and meetings
that could've been raven-mail.

827
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,189
I miss fighting.

828
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:20,524
I miss my sisters.

829
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,484
Which is why you need to come,
'cause I need one.

830
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:24,611
Okay, we should go.

831
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:25,988
You packed?

832
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:27,573
Are you packed?

833
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:30,909
Yes!

834
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:33,954
A hand grenade?

835
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,290
No. It's a portable speaker.

836
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:43,422
Let's go.

837
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,884
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps?

838
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:49,344
I got you.

839
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,765
My fellow Asgardians...

840
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:56,101
Wish us well, for we shall travel

841
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:58,270
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

842
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:01,148
We will return with children.

843
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:04,276
Many children.

844
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:06,069
And then we shall feast!

845
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,863
Not on the children.

846
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,656
We do not do that anymore.

847
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,701
Those were dark times. Shameful times.

848
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,411
Okay, we should go.

849
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,751
So, you still rollerblading?

850
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,670
No. No. You?

851
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,088
Oh, yeah. Every weekend.

852
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,964
Once you blade, you never fade.
Right, Korg?

853
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:08,882
Skate mates for life!

854
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,592
Hey, can I run something by you?

855
00:50:10,676 --> 00:50:12,177
- Yeah.
- So, I was thinking,

856
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,637
when we get to the bad guy,

857
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,806
what about if I had, like,
a cool catchphrase?

858
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:18,433
Like, "Eat this hammer!" Bang!

859
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:19,685
Or, like,

860
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:21,770
"Check out my hammer." Boom!

861
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:23,563
Like, what about, um...

862
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,607
No... I'm workshopping it.

863
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:28,110
No, they are all really good.
Mine is, uh,

864
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,112
"This ends here and now."

865
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:31,363
Oh, that's such a good one.

866
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,781
Took me a long time to perfect it.

867
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,199
You'll get there.
You just need to practise.

868
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:35,701
Just my first bad guy.

869
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,119
You never forget your first.

870
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:41,540
Yeah.

871
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,458
So, you got a girlfriend?

872
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:45,669
Oh... No, no.

873
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,629
Too busy, don't have time, you know?

874
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,048
Just the work and everything.

875
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:52,634
Cool. Gonna check this place out.

876
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:56,680
Oh, wow.

877
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:57,764
So cool.

878
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:58,932
- Who's so cool?
- Huh?

879
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,559
The buildings are cool.

880
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,477
- What's happening there?
- Where?

881
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:05,147
Am I, uh, sensing feelings?

882
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,231
Feelings?

883
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:07,524
- What, for Jane?
- Mm-hmm.

884
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:09,067
No, don't be ridiculous. Feelings.

885
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:10,986
The last time we had feelings were

886
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:12,821
long time ago.
Long, long gone. I think you...

887
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:14,364
- Maybe you have feelings.
- Right.

888
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:16,158
Oh... Mate, relax.

889
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,367
- I don't know.
- We're on the same team.

890
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:19,953
Know exactly what team we're on, okay?

891
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,455
Team Jane.

892
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:24,374
Um...

893
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,253
<i>Thing about Thor is that</i>
<i>he always bounces back.</i>

894
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:30,380
- Yeah.
- Like when Hela stole his hammer,

895
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:31,673
he went and built an axe
which was forged

896
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:33,216
in the heart of a dying star.

897
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,347
And the same axe was used
to cut off Thanos' head.

898
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:42,142
That's a good one.

899
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:47,773
What a neat story!

900
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:52,944
Ah, with all this talk
about chopping off heads,

901
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:54,446
I wanna have a go.

902
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,823
What's this?

903
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:57,908
Oh.

904
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,536
Aw!

905
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,122
This is Octy. Hello, Octy.

906
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:06,374
How are you?

907
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,418
You know what Octy loves?

908
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:10,837
Having his head ripped off!

909
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:17,427
What? You liked it a second ago.

910
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:20,013
All right, all right, all right.

911
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:21,306
Octy's gone.

912
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:27,103
Come on.

913
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,355
I'm scared.

914
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,190
Aw, look at you.

915
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:34,361
I knew a little girl just like you.

916
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:38,532
And she was brave, and she was smart...

917
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:43,787
and funny and she liked to draw.

918
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:48,291
Let me ask you a question

919
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:51,044
about gods.

920
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:53,630
They're meant to protect you, right?

921
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:55,632
Well, where are they?

922
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,635
- Thor is on his way.
- Yeah!

923
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:01,346
Yes. I'm counting on that.

924
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:03,723
That's why you're here.

925
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:08,603
It's invitation only,

926
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:10,105
so we're gonna have to keep
a low profile and blend in.

927
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,149
Luckily, disguises are my specialty.

928
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:14,985
Greek philosopher?

929
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:16,570
Got us these.

930
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,196
What are those?

931
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:19,322
Actual disguises.

932
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,200
They're the cloaks of the emotion gods.

933
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:26,037
Every colour signifies
a different emotion.

934
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:27,956
Where are the emotion gods?

935
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,541
Mm. Don't ask.

936
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,087
Holy shit.

937
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,098
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

938
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:47,309
This is where
the most powerful creator gods

939
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:48,476
in the universe hang out.

940
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:53,940
There's the god of magic,

941
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,233
the god of dreams,

942
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:56,443
the god of carpentry.

943
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:57,903
Look at that one.

944
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,613
Oh, yes. That's Bao, god of dumplings.

945
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:01,907
- Psst. Hey, Bao!
- Bao.

946
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,074
Look up there, guys!

947
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:04,993
That's the Kronan god,
Ninny of the Nonny.

948
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:07,329
Hey, Ninny Nonny!

949
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:20,467
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

950
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,094
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

951
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:25,805
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

952
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:28,099
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

953
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,729
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

954
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:35,231
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

955
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:37,484
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

956
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,653
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

957
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:41,863
Zeus! Zeus!

958
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:50,956
Yes.

959
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:53,583
I am Zeus!

960
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:55,919
<i>Yassas!</i>

961
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:59,297
Oh, there he is!

962
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:01,424
The man, the myth, the legend.

963
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:02,759
Oh, I don't know if you know this,

964
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:05,011
but I base a lot of what I do
on this guy.

965
00:55:05,178 --> 00:55:06,888
He's the god of lightning,
I'm the god of thunder.

966
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:09,140
- Huge source of inspiration.
- That's really good.

967
00:55:09,224 --> 00:55:11,685
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

968
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:13,728
- Ah.
- Um, how do we get up there?

969
00:55:13,812 --> 00:55:15,397
Do we just, like, fly?

970
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,898
No, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of an entrance.

971
00:55:16,982 --> 00:55:18,692
He's famous for his entrances.

972
00:55:18,775 --> 00:55:20,568
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!

973
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:23,279
Yes!

974
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:26,658
Zeus!

975
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,669
Yes! Thunderbolt!

976
00:55:45,427 --> 00:55:46,428
Order.

977
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:48,096
Order!

978
00:55:49,973 --> 00:55:52,392
Silence! Silence!

979
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:58,523
I hereby open

980
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,527
this holy council of the god.

981
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,905
Where we have many, many serious matter

982
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:07,323
to be talk about.

983
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:08,908
Such as,

984
00:56:09,826 --> 00:56:11,995
where are we going to hold
this year's orgy?

985
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:14,122
Is this guy for real?

986
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:15,373
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

987
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah, I'm sure he has a point, okay?

988
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,793
Sorry.

989
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:20,086
So now we're going to
announce the winner

990
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,048
of the, "Most human souls

991
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:25,258
"sacrificed in the name of a god."

992
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,010
Okay, maybe he's not that great.

993
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,428
Oh, no, not good.

994
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:30,430
No, I don't think it's gonna
get any better than this.

995
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:31,890
Look, these gods aren't gonna help.

996
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:33,058
But that thunderbolt,

997
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:34,517
I think that might be of use.

998
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:36,603
Jane, you go right. Thor, you go left.

999
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:37,812
We bum-rush him,

1000
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:39,189
take the bolt, ding-dong.

1001
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:40,315
All right, let's go get it!

1002
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:41,566
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

1003
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,401
There's no ding-donging or bum-rushing.

1004
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:44,903
Especially not Zeus' bum.

1005
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:46,571
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

1006
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:47,697
The time is right now.

1007
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:49,282
Time is not right now.

1008
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:50,241
Who is talking?

1009
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:51,409
Who is talking?

1010
00:56:51,493 --> 00:56:52,410
- These guys.
- Korg, shut up.

1011
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:55,371
Do you have something to say
to the group?

1012
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:56,873
Sorry.

1013
00:56:56,956 --> 00:56:59,667
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds,
so speak fast.

1014
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,252
Literally, heads will roll.

1015
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:03,338
Who are you two?

1016
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,632
Hello.

1017
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:07,133
Uh, let me be the first to say

1018
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:08,426
it is an honour and a privilege to be...

1019
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:09,636
No, I can't hear you.

1020
00:57:09,803 --> 00:57:11,137
Why don't you take the stage?

1021
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:13,181
The stage down there?

1022
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:15,225
Well, yes. You see the area

1023
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:17,602
that looks very much like a stage?

1024
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:20,188
Got ya.

1025
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:28,780
Coming through.

1026
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:30,824
Oops. Sorry.

1027
00:57:30,907 --> 00:57:31,991
Good luck, bro.

1028
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,084
Mighty Zeus!

1029
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:42,752
Wow!

1030
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:44,921
Gods of the universe,

1031
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:47,340
I come here to ask for your help,

1032
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:48,675
to raise an army.

1033
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:50,718
There's a maniac called the God Butcher

1034
00:57:50,802 --> 00:57:52,095
who seeks to end us all.

1035
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:53,638
His destruction is everywhere.

1036
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:55,807
Entire planets, realms

1037
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:57,517
have been left completely unprotected.

1038
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,727
He's left nothing but chaos in his wake.

1039
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:01,813
But I know where he is,

1040
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:03,148
and with your help,

1041
00:58:03,231 --> 00:58:06,025
we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.

1042
00:58:06,151 --> 00:58:07,819
That guy,

1043
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:10,905
he killed a couple of low-level god.

1044
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,198
Eh. Boo-hoo.

1045
00:58:12,282 --> 00:58:13,825
If that's all,

1046
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:15,034
pretty boy...

1047
00:58:15,118 --> 00:58:16,911
...you go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

1048
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:18,913
Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you not hear

1049
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:20,123
any of what I just said?

1050
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:22,208
He's... He's murdering en masse.

1051
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:24,460
I tell you one time,

1052
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:25,628
now, you shut up.

1053
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:26,796
You be quiet.

1054
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,716
Because you are this close to
being uninvited to the orgy.

1055
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:32,051
Zeus, we must do something.

1056
00:58:32,135 --> 00:58:34,012
You cannot come to the orgy!

1057
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:36,097
- You have to listen to us!
- That's it!

1058
00:58:36,181 --> 00:58:37,640
Shackle!

1059
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:41,811
Your Highness,
whenever you're ready, you just tell me.

1060
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,062
- We go on my signal.
- Mm-hmm.

1061
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:44,272
What is the signal?

1062
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,773
- It'll be, "Go."
- Hmm.

1063
00:58:49,611 --> 00:58:50,862
Let's see who you are.

1064
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:52,614
I take off your disguise.

1065
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:53,740
And flick!

1066
00:59:01,998 --> 00:59:03,708
You flicked too hard, damn it!

1067
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,379
Should we help him?

1068
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:09,881
I mean, eventually.

1069
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:11,090
Grape?

1070
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:12,926
Mm, looks like a shy courgette.

1071
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:14,969
And what about the others?

1072
00:59:15,053 --> 00:59:16,137
We take off their disguise too.

1073
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:17,513
Oh, no. No. Don't flick us.

1074
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:18,681
It's cool.

1075
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,266
Uh... Disguise gone!

1076
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:21,351
Disguise off. Cool?

1077
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:22,727
Asgardians.

1078
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,688
I thought we'd seen the last
of you when Odin died.

1079
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:29,525
You are Thor,

1080
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,486
the God of Thunder.

1081
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:35,448
But is not thunder
just the sound of lightning?

1082
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:38,952
Good one, Dad.

1083
00:59:39,035 --> 00:59:40,328
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

1084
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,497
He's taken Asgardian children.

1085
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,917
Who do you think we are? The god police?

1086
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:49,754
Every god watches over
their own peoples.

1087
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:52,799
Nothing more, nothing less.

1088
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:54,634
Asgardian problems

1089
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,263
are Asgardian problems. Hmm?

1090
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:00,348
How the mighty have fallen.

1091
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:02,684
My hero, Zeus,

1092
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:03,851
afraid.

1093
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:18,032
Couple of thing.

1094
01:00:18,116 --> 01:00:21,077
One, yes, I am scared.

1095
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,955
Gorr has the Necrosword,

1096
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:26,249
which means he could kill us.

1097
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:28,167
Not good. Two,

1098
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:30,253
I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

1099
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,671
I understand.

1100
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:33,965
But all you do is cause a panic.

1101
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:36,092
Panic is not good.

1102
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:37,760
We are safe here.

1103
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:40,305
You, my friend, you are safe here.

1104
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:42,515
So, chill, baby cake.

1105
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:45,226
Have some wine, have some grape.

1106
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,853
Anything goes here

1107
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:49,272
in Omnipotence City. Hmm.

1108
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:52,483
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

1109
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:55,028
I flicked too hard.
I put your clothes back on.

1110
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,114
Now I put your clothes back on!

1111
01:00:58,197 --> 01:00:59,157
Flick, flick.

1112
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,742
For this is the Golden Temple

1113
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:02,076
of the god.

1114
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,954
It's not a rudie-nudie festival.

1115
01:01:05,038 --> 01:01:06,205
If you're not gonna help us,

1116
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:07,915
then at least let us use your weapon.

1117
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:09,417
We need your lightning bolt.

1118
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:12,295
My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.

1119
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:15,673
So, I think, to use somebody's
secret weapon like this,

1120
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,384
that you should at least get
the name right when you ask.

1121
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,720
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

1122
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,722
Thunderbolt!

1123
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:50,083
No!

1124
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:55,838
Do not worry.

1125
01:01:56,506 --> 01:01:58,216
The God Butcher,

1126
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:00,802
he will not reach Eternity.

1127
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:02,178
Eternity?

1128
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:04,055
What does he mean, reach Eternity?

1129
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:09,310
Oh, shit.

1130
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:14,774
Eternity is a very powerful being

1131
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:16,317
at the centre of the universe.

1132
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,152
It will grant the desire

1133
01:02:18,236 --> 01:02:20,071
of the first person who reaches it.

1134
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:22,073
So, it's like a wishing well?

1135
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:26,244
What do you think a guy
called the God Butcher

1136
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:27,412
would wish for?

1137
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:28,663
If he seeks the Altar of Eternity,

1138
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:30,373
that means he could wipe us out at once.

1139
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,125
Zeus, we must act now.

1140
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:34,043
He's not going to make it.

1141
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,503
He doesn't have the key.

1142
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:37,839
Is this the purpose of the gods?

1143
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,800
To hide away in a golden
palace like cowards?

1144
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:42,885
Maybe we have lost our way.

1145
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:45,012
You know what? We'll stop him ourselves.

1146
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:47,223
I am afraid I cannot allow that.

1147
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,934
This is a secret place

1148
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:51,894
known only to the gods.

1149
01:02:51,978 --> 01:02:54,021
You know where we are.

1150
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:57,775
The God Butcher could use you
to find us.

1151
01:02:58,568 --> 01:02:59,861
This is no good.

1152
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:02,029
So now,

1153
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:04,782
you must stay.

1154
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:07,160
Guards!

1155
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:10,955
Hey.

1156
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:11,914
Can we do my plan now?

1157
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:13,916
Yes. Rush his bum.

1158
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,376
Hell, yeah!

1159
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,672
Oh, you didn't say, "Go."

1160
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,511
Coming, guys!

1161
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:36,772
Thor, catch!

1162
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:40,943
Korg!

1163
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:01,506
Val, duck!

1164
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:07,970
Korg!

1165
01:04:10,223 --> 01:04:11,599
Thor.

1166
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:14,769
Oh, no. No. Korg!

1167
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:18,898
Thor, I'm... I'm perishing!

1168
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:24,820
Zeus!

1169
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:28,366
You're next, Odinson!

1170
01:04:36,165 --> 01:04:38,376
That's the sound of lightning.

1171
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:46,759
No!

1172
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:48,302
Korgi.

1173
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:49,554
Korgi!

1174
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:50,680
Thor.

1175
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:52,306
- Korgi?
- I'm down here.

1176
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:53,474
Where? Where are you?

1177
01:04:53,558 --> 01:04:54,642
I'm gonna get you out. It's okay.

1178
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,185
- Korg. Korgi!
- Here I am!

1179
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:57,270
I didn't die!

1180
01:04:57,353 --> 01:04:59,564
Oh, my God. Yes! You're alive!

1181
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,190
Turns out the only part
of a Kronan that's alive

1182
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:02,275
is his mouth.

1183
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:04,694
Korgi, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

1184
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:05,778
I'll do my best.

1185
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:07,154
Guard him with your life.

1186
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:09,240
I will. Ready to go for a ride?

1187
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:14,870
Now you've got my six.

1188
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:16,581
Eight o'clock, Val.

1189
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,583
7:48.

1190
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:22,044
I can do this, damn it.

1191
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:23,421
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

1192
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:24,547
Nope.

1193
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:27,216
Come on, Korg,
purse those lips.

1194
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:41,939
I did it!

1195
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:22,021
And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us,

1196
01:06:22,104 --> 01:06:23,522
and we flew out the window.

1197
01:06:23,606 --> 01:06:24,732
The end.

1198
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,359
Another classic Thor adventure.

1199
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:28,569
I can't believe you killed Zeus.

1200
01:06:28,653 --> 01:06:31,864
Well, you know what they say,
never meet your heroes.

1201
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:34,367
But what's important

1202
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,327
is we are on our way to you right now.

1203
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,828
How are you guys doing? Are you okay?

1204
01:06:37,912 --> 01:06:39,622
We're all right. A little scared.

1205
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:41,749
Well, listen, I know
what it's like to be scared.

1206
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,501
And I'll tell you, when I was your age,

1207
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:45,419
I don't think I would have
been as brave as you.

1208
01:06:45,503 --> 01:06:46,462
Really?

1209
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:47,630
In fact, might just be

1210
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:49,465
the bravest Asgardians
that I've ever met.

1211
01:06:49,548 --> 01:06:50,883
All of you.

1212
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:52,885
So I need you to
keep being brave, all right?

1213
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:55,179
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

1214
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:56,764
Team Kids in a Cage.

1215
01:06:58,432 --> 01:06:59,433
Can you do that?

1216
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,186
Yeah. I think we can do that.

1217
01:07:02,937 --> 01:07:03,938
I know you can.

1218
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:08,401
Right?

1219
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:10,236
- Thor?
- Yeah.

1220
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,904
I'm glad I met my hero.

1221
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:13,698
Oh, thanks, buddy.

1222
01:07:17,702 --> 01:07:18,953
How are the children?

1223
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,454
As you can imagine,
they're a little bit scared

1224
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:21,539
because they're kids,

1225
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,040
but I told them that
everything is going to plan.

1226
01:07:23,124 --> 01:07:25,084
- Oh, so you lied to them?
- We still have a plan?

1227
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,377
- Yes, there's a plan.
- There's no plan.

1228
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,504
- There is a plan.
- No. There's no plan.

1229
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:30,715
We failed to raise a god army,

1230
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:31,924
Korg is dead.

1231
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:33,300
- He's not dead.
- I'm not dead.

1232
01:07:33,384 --> 01:07:34,760
Well, he's a head. And you,

1233
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:36,345
you got properly humiliated.

1234
01:07:36,429 --> 01:07:38,764
No, I got properly naked,
which I am okay with.

1235
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:40,641
- Jane?
- I was okay with it.

1236
01:07:40,725 --> 01:07:41,809
- Korg?
- I loved it.

1237
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:43,853
The point is, we are going
into the Shadow Realm

1238
01:07:43,936 --> 01:07:45,229
weaker than we were before.

1239
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:46,605
I mean, we're gonna die.

1240
01:07:46,689 --> 01:07:48,315
- No one's gonna die, okay?
- Really?

1241
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:50,735
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

1242
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:52,820
- We killed Zeus!
- You killed Zeus.

1243
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:54,447
I mean, that may
or may not be catastrophic

1244
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:55,906
for the whole universe,

1245
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,033
and, sure, the entire
god kingdom is probably going

1246
01:07:58,117 --> 01:07:59,577
to hunt us down
for the rest of our days,

1247
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:02,163
but listen,
you stole this beautiful weapon.

1248
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,206
All right? This is the army right here.

1249
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:05,833
It's sleek, it's slender,

1250
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,418
it's powerful, it's beautiful...

1251
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,338
Ah, for you.
I love it for you, Valkyrie.

1252
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:13,048
I mean, it's not really what I'm into

1253
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:15,009
'cause I've got my weapon out there.

1254
01:08:15,176 --> 01:08:16,802
Can I borrow that for a second?

1255
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:22,057
Ah, there you are, old friend.

1256
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:24,935
That was quite an entrance back there.

1257
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:31,942
Listen, uh,

1258
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:33,360
are we good?

1259
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:34,695
Yeah?

1260
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:35,780
I mean, I know it's a little weird

1261
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:37,239
having my ex-weapon around,

1262
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,909
but come on, Mjolnir, in the past.

1263
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:41,744
It's you and me now, buddy.

1264
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,245
You know what?

1265
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,040
I think it's time for your first beer.
What do you say?

1266
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:53,005
Delicious.

1267
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:55,299
Hmm.
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1268
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:04,308
Hey.

1269
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:05,726
Oh, hey.

1270
01:09:08,521 --> 01:09:10,856
It's quite the view, huh?

1271
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,024
Yeah. Beautiful.

1272
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:14,235
I just want to say
that was very, very impressive

1273
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:15,778
what you did back there.

1274
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,364
You and Mjolnir, you know.

1275
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:21,951
Yeah.

1276
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:26,372
- Space dolphins.
- What?

1277
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:28,791
You should see
some space dolphins...

1278
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,417
What?

1279
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:32,169
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

1280
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:34,505
Beautiful. Wow.

1281
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,048
So beautiful. So rare.

1282
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,424
Very loyal creatures.

1283
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:40,219
They mate for life, in packs of six.

1284
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:42,054
Just love.

1285
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,074
That is the song that my dad sang

1286
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:03,784
to my other dad when they were courting.

1287
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:05,411
When two Kronans wanna make a baby,

1288
01:10:05,494 --> 01:10:06,871
they get together inside a mountain,

1289
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,789
and they go down to a little lava pool,

1290
01:10:08,873 --> 01:10:10,499
and they hold hands over the hot lava,

1291
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:12,918
and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart

1292
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:14,086
and they find they've created

1293
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:16,088
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1294
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:18,465
Mm, fascinating. And hot.

1295
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:19,967
Did you ever have a special someone?

1296
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,928
I've had
so many special someones.

1297
01:10:23,012 --> 01:10:25,306
But I don't know...

1298
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,725
I don't know if I want that again.

1299
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:29,184
Is that because you lost
your girlfriend in battle

1300
01:10:29,268 --> 01:10:30,519
and never forgave yourself?

1301
01:10:30,603 --> 01:10:31,645
And now, you're just trying

1302
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:33,105
to find answers
in the bottom of a bottle,

1303
01:10:33,272 --> 01:10:34,773
or some meaningless dalliance,

1304
01:10:34,857 --> 01:10:36,191
which only serves to numb the pain

1305
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:37,359
instead of bringing you

1306
01:10:37,443 --> 01:10:38,903
real happiness or satisfaction?

1307
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:42,448
- Yeah. Something like that.
- Hmm.

1308
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:47,077
Beautiful. Beautiful things.

1309
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,374
Jane.

1310
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:53,834
Thor.

1311
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:55,294
I wanna feel shitty about you.

1312
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,462
What?

1313
01:11:00,466 --> 01:11:02,593
I wanna feel shitty about something

1314
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,178
and I think that's you.

1315
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:05,304
Not really getting any better.

1316
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:06,972
It's not, is it? Damn it.

1317
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:08,515
I wanna...

1318
01:11:08,599 --> 01:11:11,268
My friend, he told me that
it's better to feel shitty

1319
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:14,480
from losing love than it is
to never experience love

1320
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:16,065
and to feel nothing at all,
to feel empty,

1321
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:17,316
and I think he was right,

1322
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:20,611
which is how I've been feeling
for a long time.

1323
01:11:20,778 --> 01:11:23,072
I've pushed people away,
kept them at a distance

1324
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,531
because of the fear of that loss,

1325
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:25,491
but I don't wanna do that anymore.

1326
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:26,825
I don't wanna live like that.

1327
01:11:26,909 --> 01:11:28,619
Better to close off your heart
than feel the pain.

1328
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:30,871
That's what I did, yes.
I closed off my heart

1329
01:11:30,955 --> 01:11:32,831
and... and I meditated. Did you meditate?

1330
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:34,208
No. It's so boring.

1331
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,460
It actually made me more angry.

1332
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:39,672
But I'm tired of giving myself
over to the idea of fate

1333
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:41,632
and trying to figure out what
the universe wants from me.

1334
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:43,092
I wanna live in the moment,

1335
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:44,551
I wanna live like there's no tomorrow,

1336
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:45,886
throw caution to the wind. I want...

1337
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:48,013
- I wanna be with you, Jane.
- Ah.

1338
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:49,723
What do you say?

1339
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:52,309
I have cancer.

1340
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:55,729
I'm sorry, what?

1341
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:57,356
I'm sick.

1342
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,108
- Wait. What's happening?
- Bye.

1343
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,485
- Uh...
- No, no, no. Jane, Jane, Jane.

1344
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:02,861
- Wait, wait, wait. Jane.
- What did I say?

1345
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:04,863
I didn't mean that. Just kidding.

1346
01:12:04,947 --> 01:12:05,948
I...

1347
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,117
don't have cancer.

1348
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,660
Let's go smash something.

1349
01:12:10,411 --> 01:12:11,453
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1350
01:12:11,537 --> 01:12:13,539
Don't be sorry for me.

1351
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:16,625
When did you find out?

1352
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:18,711
Um...

1353
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,587
Like six months ago.

1354
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:22,840
I was just feeling tired, and then

1355
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:24,550
they told me I have Stage Four.

1356
01:12:24,717 --> 01:12:26,427
Get my affairs in order.

1357
01:12:27,261 --> 01:12:29,680
And then I heard Mjolnir calling me,

1358
01:12:30,389 --> 01:12:32,933
so I thought maybe,
if science isn't working,

1359
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:37,187
maybe Viking space magic.

1360
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:38,814
That's why you came to New Asgard.

1361
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:41,775
Yeah, I thought the hammer
maybe could cure me,

1362
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:44,862
and I think it's getting better.

1363
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:46,989
Maybe not.

1364
01:12:48,032 --> 01:12:50,242
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1365
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:52,661
We don't know what tomorrow holds.

1366
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:53,829
And Mjolnir...

1367
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:55,497
Mjolnir chose you.

1368
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:58,208
And it chose you because you're worthy.

1369
01:12:58,375 --> 01:12:59,626
And that's something.

1370
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:01,003
When I first met you,

1371
01:13:01,587 --> 01:13:02,588
I was unworthy.

1372
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:04,214
I was unable to pick up that hammer.

1373
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,258
But you taught me

1374
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:09,386
there is no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

1375
01:13:10,137 --> 01:13:12,222
You made me worthy.

1376
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:15,851
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

1377
01:13:18,062 --> 01:13:19,104
Okay.

1378
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:20,981
Now what do you wanna do?

1379
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:24,777
I wanna get those children
back to their families.

1380
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:26,236
I wanna finish that mission.

1381
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:29,031
- Spoken like a true Thor.
- Hmm.

1382
01:13:30,616 --> 01:13:31,992
How do you feel now?

1383
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,286
So scared.

1384
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:36,538
How are you feeling?

1385
01:13:36,705 --> 01:13:37,998
Shitty.

1386
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:39,041
How shitty?

1387
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,751
- Really shitty.
- Well, then...

1388
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:53,972
I wonder what those two
are talking about out there.

1389
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:57,101
- Yeah, they're not talking.
- Oh!

1390
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,062
Do you think those two
will ever hold hands

1391
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:02,898
over a hot lava pool
and make a Thor baby?

1392
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:06,860
It's unlikely, sadly.

1393
01:14:06,944 --> 01:14:08,654
Mm, that's too bad.

1394
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:10,197
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1395
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:14,785
Hey. We're here.

1396
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,295
Where did all the colour go?

1397
01:14:58,579 --> 01:14:59,997
They're not here.

1398
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:06,628
Where are they?

1399
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,566
What the hell is this place?

1400
01:15:55,886 --> 01:15:57,971
Bifrost is the key?

1401
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:08,607
It's a trap!

1402
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:27,125
You wanna tell me
why you just threw

1403
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:28,377
Stormbreaker out the window?

1404
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,671
He needs it to open
the Gates of Eternity.

1405
01:17:01,994 --> 01:17:03,662
We really have to
stop meeting like this.

1406
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:04,871
Call the axe.

1407
01:17:04,955 --> 01:17:06,540
I'll call the axe
when you call the dentist.

1408
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:09,334
Call the axe.

1409
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,920
Tell me where the children are
or I'm gonna kill you.

1410
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:19,970
Call the axe.

1411
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:29,021
Some god you are.

1412
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:33,233
You know nothing of being a god.

1413
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:40,449
You went to the gods for help,
and they did nothing.

1414
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:43,368
We're alike in that sense.

1415
01:17:43,452 --> 01:17:45,037
He's nothing like you.

1416
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,621
What was that?

1417
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,585
I said he's nothing like you.

1418
01:17:51,752 --> 01:17:53,128
That's right.

1419
01:17:53,295 --> 01:17:57,758
I'm not a hypocrite.
I'm truly creating peace.

1420
01:17:57,841 --> 01:17:59,676
Peace? You're murdering innocent gods.

1421
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,886
Innocent?

1422
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:03,055
Are you a Valkyrie?

1423
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:04,139
Yes.

1424
01:18:04,222 --> 01:18:06,808
How exciting!

1425
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:10,937
Oh, the gods failed you, too,

1426
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:15,150
when your sisterhood
was led to slaughter.

1427
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:16,318
Don't you dare speak...

1428
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,237
Did you pray to the gods

1429
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:23,533
when the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

1430
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:27,454
Did you beg them for help

1431
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:30,248
as your family was massacred?

1432
01:18:32,918 --> 01:18:34,127
Good chat.

1433
01:18:37,589 --> 01:18:39,132
This one.

1434
01:18:39,216 --> 01:18:41,385
You're interesting.

1435
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,054
You're different.

1436
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:45,889
Yes.

1437
01:18:48,475 --> 01:18:50,602
Aw.

1438
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:55,565
You're dying.

1439
01:18:57,317 --> 01:18:58,610
I'm sorry.

1440
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:01,613
We're on the same path.

1441
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:07,160
Just as the sword empowered me,

1442
01:19:07,828 --> 01:19:09,955
the hammer empowered you.

1443
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:13,625
But it did nothing to change your fate.

1444
01:19:14,626 --> 01:19:17,754
The gods will use you,

1445
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:21,425
but they will not help you.

1446
01:19:22,008 --> 01:19:26,930
There is no eternal reward for us.

1447
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:35,063
She'll be gone soon.

1448
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:38,650
And you know who won't help her?

1449
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:40,569
I'll give you one guess.

1450
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,165
I know your pain.

1451
01:19:53,248 --> 01:19:55,333
Love is pain.

1452
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,299
I had a daughter once.

1453
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,093
I put my faith in a higher power

1454
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,971
hoping it would save her,

1455
01:20:08,138 --> 01:20:09,806
and she...

1456
01:20:11,016 --> 01:20:12,726
died.

1457
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:18,940
Now I understand.

1458
01:20:19,024 --> 01:20:21,276
My daughter is the lucky one.

1459
01:20:21,902 --> 01:20:27,115
She does not have to grow up
in a world of suffering

1460
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:28,783
and pain

1461
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:33,205
run by wicked gods.

1462
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:37,250
Choose love.

1463
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:41,838
Call the axe.

1464
01:20:50,514 --> 01:20:52,557
Call

1465
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,434
the axe.

1466
01:21:30,637 --> 01:21:31,888
You okay?

1467
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:33,223
Yeah.

1468
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,143
Mm, I wanna kill this guy.

1469
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,771
So do I, but we have to take him alive.

1470
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:42,023
He's our only link
to finding those children.

1471
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:57,641
Oh! Thank you, Mr Goat.

1472
01:23:29,506 --> 01:23:31,549
Val!

1473
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:44,062
We gotta get her out of here!

1474
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,115
Hey. I got you.

1475
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:08,086
Hey, guys, we're here.
Come on, let's go.

1476
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:10,338
Stormbreaker, take us home.

1477
01:25:05,769 --> 01:25:08,021
...at a rate that
none of us have seen before.

1478
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:09,606
Look, there are other more

1479
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:11,566
aggressive forms of treatment
we can try,

1480
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:12,734
but something's affecting

1481
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:14,778
her body's ability to fight the cancer.

1482
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:17,238
I'm sorry, Thor.

1483
01:25:31,044 --> 01:25:32,921
Oh, there you are. Okay.

1484
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:34,130
What's goin' on out there?

1485
01:25:34,214 --> 01:25:36,174
Oh, some moron made
a fridge without a door.

1486
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:37,258
Can you believe it?

1487
01:25:37,342 --> 01:25:38,384
Not to worry. Got it open

1488
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:40,303
and got you all sorts of goodies.

1489
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:41,596
How's Val?

1490
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,098
Oh, she's in a lot of pain,
uh, but she is stable.

1491
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:45,308
Okay, good.

1492
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:48,311
Now you just gotta get this out of my...

1493
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:49,938
Oh, no, no, no.
That's gotta stay in there.

1494
01:25:50,021 --> 01:25:51,898
That's all the magic potions and elixirs

1495
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:53,233
doing their thing, so...

1496
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:54,943
I'm just gonna pop out for a moment,

1497
01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:56,694
pick up the kids, kill the bad guy,

1498
01:25:56,778 --> 01:25:57,904
and then I'll come straight back.

1499
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:00,657
You're going without me?

1500
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:02,325
Uh, yeah.

1501
01:26:02,492 --> 01:26:04,536
What happened to, like,
doing everything together?

1502
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:06,538
He's gonna use those kids
to distract you.

1503
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:07,622
You need me.

1504
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:09,791
I do need you, Jane. I need you alive.

1505
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:11,751
It'd be great to have you
on the battlefield,

1506
01:26:11,835 --> 01:26:13,419
fighting Gorr side by side,

1507
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:15,380
but that hammer is killing you.

1508
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:17,632
Every time you use it,

1509
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,592
it's draining
all of your mortal strength,

1510
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:22,053
leaving your body
unable to fight the cancer.

1511
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,764
What happened to,
"Live like there's no tomorrow"?

1512
01:26:24,848 --> 01:26:26,683
Well, that's before I knew
you might not have one.

1513
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:28,268
Why not have one more adventure?

1514
01:26:28,476 --> 01:26:30,186
Jane, if there's a chance to live,
you have to take it.

1515
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,690
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

1516
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:39,737
I know I seem like
some cool astrophysicist

1517
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:41,072
from New Mexico,

1518
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:43,908
just living the dream, but look at me.

1519
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:47,871
I wanna keep fighting.
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1520
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:49,038
And you want me not to do that?

1521
01:26:49,122 --> 01:26:51,875
What's the point of more time of this?

1522
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:54,460
Because I love you.

1523
01:26:56,546 --> 01:26:58,715
I've always loved you.

1524
01:26:59,674 --> 01:27:01,718
And this is a chance for us.

1525
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:04,304
But if you pick up
that damn hammer again,

1526
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:06,097
then that chance is gone.

1527
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,485
It's your choice, Jane.

1528
01:27:20,445 --> 01:27:22,280
But I'd regret it every single day

1529
01:27:22,363 --> 01:27:23,489
if I didn't ask you to stay here

1530
01:27:23,573 --> 01:27:25,533
so we could try and figure
this out together.

1531
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:30,705
You better come back to me.

1532
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:33,416
I'm coming back as soon as I can.

1533
01:27:35,919 --> 01:27:38,546
- Break a leg.
- I'll break all his legs.

1534
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:53,144
Remember that the Gate to Eternity

1535
01:27:53,227 --> 01:27:54,228
is at the literal centre

1536
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:55,438
- of the universe.
- Universe. Yes.

1537
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:56,856
If you go past the cluster of comets...

1538
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:57,941
Yes, yes, I know. We've been over this.

1539
01:27:58,024 --> 01:27:59,108
I'm not gonna get lost.

1540
01:27:59,651 --> 01:28:02,320
So how you feeling
with the old stab wound?

1541
01:28:02,403 --> 01:28:03,529
I think I lost my kidney.

1542
01:28:03,613 --> 01:28:05,073
- Gone completely? Ugh.
- Mm.

1543
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:06,074
I wish I could join you,

1544
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:07,492
but I'd probably die,

1545
01:28:07,575 --> 01:28:08,993
and that won't help get the kids back,

1546
01:28:09,077 --> 01:28:10,453
so you'll have to go alone.

1547
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:13,623
All you have to do
is destroy that sword.

1548
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:14,874
It's his source of power.

1549
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:16,417
He won't survive long without it.

1550
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:20,380
Hey. Don't die.

1551
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:21,923
Yeah, I know.

1552
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,687
Eternity.

1553
01:29:20,023 --> 01:29:21,274
Finally.

1554
01:29:35,997 --> 01:29:37,415
Come on.

1555
01:30:03,149 --> 01:30:04,150
Hey, kids.

1556
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:08,154
I knew he'd come.

1557
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:09,906
Go!

1558
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:11,074
Go, kids!

1559
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:22,919
Everyone okay? All right,
gather round. Gather round.

1560
01:30:23,503 --> 01:30:26,130
Good to see you in person, buddy.
Good to see you.

1561
01:30:37,058 --> 01:30:38,476
All right, listen up. Here's the plan.

1562
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:40,770
We're gonna sneak our way
towards Stormbreaker,

1563
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:42,438
being very careful not to bump

1564
01:30:42,522 --> 01:30:44,607
into any of those big shadow monsters.

1565
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:47,485
They're behind me, aren't they?

1566
01:30:53,407 --> 01:30:54,909
Does anyone here have battle experience?

1567
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,160
Battle experience?

1568
01:30:56,244 --> 01:30:58,162
Well, no time to learn like the present.

1569
01:30:58,246 --> 01:31:00,748
We're not strong like you.
We're just kids.

1570
01:31:00,832 --> 01:31:03,292
Hey, don't forget you're Asgardian kids.

1571
01:31:03,376 --> 01:31:05,044
I'm not. I'm just a Lycan kid.

1572
01:31:05,128 --> 01:31:06,671
And I'm a Midassian kid.

1573
01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:08,172
- I'm Falligarian.
- Okay, okay.

1574
01:31:08,256 --> 01:31:10,258
But today, you're Asgardians.

1575
01:31:10,341 --> 01:31:11,676
Now collect your weapons.

1576
01:31:11,759 --> 01:31:12,718
What?

1577
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:14,887
Go and find anything you can pick up.

1578
01:31:14,971 --> 01:31:16,055
Bring it back here.

1579
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:17,849
Hurry, hurry!

1580
01:31:17,932 --> 01:31:19,517
Okay, cool. Come on!

1581
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:22,770
They're getting closer. Hurry up!

1582
01:31:22,854 --> 01:31:24,021
Come on!

1583
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:28,609
Today is a day
that will go down in history.

1584
01:31:29,569 --> 01:31:31,195
Today is the day they will talk about

1585
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:32,947
for generations to come.

1586
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:35,491
Today, we are Space Vikings!

1587
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,202
Present arms!

1588
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:46,169
Whosoever holds these weapons,
and believes in getting home,

1589
01:31:46,252 --> 01:31:49,088
if they be true of heart
is therefore worthy,

1590
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:50,715
and shall possess,

1591
01:31:51,716 --> 01:31:53,259
for limited time only,

1592
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:57,680
the power of Thor!

1593
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:08,232
General Axl...

1594
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:11,611
...lead your army to that axe.

1595
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:13,905
We shall do our worst.

1596
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:16,532
For Asgard.

1597
01:34:12,481 --> 01:34:14,108
Yeah!

1598
01:34:16,402 --> 01:34:17,403
No.

1599
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:33,169
Jane.

1600
01:34:50,478 --> 01:34:52,021
We destroy that sword and he's dead.

1601
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:54,231
The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Stormbreaker.

1602
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,108
It's okay. I got him.

1603
01:35:04,033 --> 01:35:05,659
Stormbreaker, stop this!

1604
01:35:06,369 --> 01:35:08,037
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing!

1605
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,538
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1606
01:35:09,622 --> 01:35:11,332
Come on.

1607
01:35:11,415 --> 01:35:13,501
Come on, buddy.

1608
01:35:18,214 --> 01:35:21,592
Let go of my friend.

1609
01:35:25,846 --> 01:35:27,264
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1610
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:35,689
First off,

1611
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:38,734
the name is Mighty Thor.

1612
01:35:40,277 --> 01:35:41,445
And secondly,

1613
01:35:41,612 --> 01:35:44,323
if you can't say Mighty Thor,

1614
01:35:44,407 --> 01:35:48,327
I'll accept Doctor Jane Foster.

1615
01:35:52,581 --> 01:35:53,582
And thirdly,

1616
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:57,169
eat my hammer!

1617
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:07,596
Stormbreaker!

1618
01:36:11,976 --> 01:36:13,394
I knew you could do it.

1619
01:36:14,562 --> 01:36:16,480
Axl! Get them home!

1620
01:38:05,297 --> 01:38:06,632
Jane?

1621
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:07,925
I'm okay.

1622
01:38:08,801 --> 01:38:09,802
You have to stop him.

1623
01:38:39,665 --> 01:38:41,292
Gorr! Stop!

1624
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:48,048
What kind of father would I be

1625
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:50,217
if I stopped?

1626
01:38:54,388 --> 01:38:57,141
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

1627
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,438
It's not death or revenge that you seek.

1628
01:39:05,024 --> 01:39:07,109
What do I seek?

1629
01:39:20,664 --> 01:39:22,082
You seek love.

1630
01:39:25,419 --> 01:39:26,712
Love?

1631
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:30,382
Why should I seek love?

1632
01:39:30,466 --> 01:39:32,301
Because it's all any of us want.

1633
01:39:34,762 --> 01:39:36,138
How

1634
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:39,850
dare you turn your back on me?

1635
01:39:41,393 --> 01:39:43,187
You've won, Gorr.

1636
01:39:43,354 --> 01:39:45,189
Why would I spend
my last moments with you

1637
01:39:45,272 --> 01:39:46,732
when I can be with her?

1638
01:39:48,108 --> 01:39:49,610
I choose love.

1639
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:52,404
You can, too. You can bring her back.

1640
01:39:56,784 --> 01:39:58,285
Make your wish.

1641
01:40:29,483 --> 01:40:30,859
I'm dying.

1642
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:33,946
She would have no one.

1643
01:40:35,197 --> 01:40:36,990
She would be alone.

1644
01:40:43,872 --> 01:40:46,458
She won't be alone.

1645
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:52,107
Oh.

1646
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:58,071
My love.

1647
01:42:07,915 --> 01:42:09,833
I've missed you so much.

1648
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,338
I missed you too.

1649
01:42:18,258 --> 01:42:19,510
I'm so sorry.

1650
01:42:19,593 --> 01:42:20,594
It's okay.

1651
01:42:22,638 --> 01:42:25,265
Ever since I picked up that hammer,

1652
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:28,018
it's like

1653
01:42:28,769 --> 01:42:30,395
I've gotten an extra life.

1654
01:42:31,688 --> 01:42:33,774
And it was...

1655
01:42:35,734 --> 01:42:36,985
magical.

1656
01:42:39,655 --> 01:42:41,907
Not too bad for a human.

1657
01:42:43,534 --> 01:42:44,910
Not too bad for a god.

1658
01:42:45,661 --> 01:42:49,998
Hey. I think I figured out
my catchphrase.

1659
01:42:50,082 --> 01:42:51,792
- Oh, yeah? What is it?
- Come close...

1660
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,924
It's perfect.

1661
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:00,717
It's the best one yet.

1662
01:43:00,801 --> 01:43:01,760
Thanks.

1663
01:43:10,269 --> 01:43:12,312
Keep your heart open.

1664
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:19,319
I love you.

1665
01:43:20,654 --> 01:43:21,780
I love you, too.

1666
01:44:07,784 --> 01:44:08,952
Protect her.

1667
01:44:10,746 --> 01:44:11,830
Protect my love.

1668
01:44:46,114 --> 01:44:49,868
<i>Let me tell you the legend</i>
<i>of the Space Viking,</i>

1669
01:44:50,702 --> 01:44:55,624
<i>AKA the Mighty Thor, AKA Dr Jane Foster.</i>

1670
01:44:58,168 --> 01:45:00,337
<i>Her sacrifice saved the universe</i>

1671
01:45:00,504 --> 01:45:04,341
<i>and taught us all</i>
<i>what it means to be worthy.</i>

1672
01:45:04,925 --> 01:45:06,802
<i>She helped the children of the gods</i>

1673
01:45:06,885 --> 01:45:08,720
<i>who laser-beamed their way back home</i>

1674
01:45:08,804 --> 01:45:11,515
<i>to their dozy little fishing village</i>

1675
01:45:11,598 --> 01:45:13,350
<i>turned tourist destination.</i>

1676
01:45:13,433 --> 01:45:15,644
Axl!

1677
01:45:15,727 --> 01:45:16,979
I missed you.

1678
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:18,689
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1679
01:45:18,772 --> 01:45:20,065
- Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

1680
01:45:20,148 --> 01:45:21,775
<i>The kids were safe to be kids again.</i>

1681
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:23,276
Louder, three!

1682
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:25,821
Widen your stance.

1683
01:45:25,904 --> 01:45:28,031
<i>Especially after</i>
<i>their king made them all go</i>

1684
01:45:28,115 --> 01:45:29,783
<i>to self-defence classes.</i>

1685
01:45:29,866 --> 01:45:31,243
<i>Look at all those budding Space Vikings.</i>

1686
01:45:31,326 --> 01:45:32,452
And the most important part.

1687
01:45:33,203 --> 01:45:34,496
The war cry!

1688
01:45:35,998 --> 01:45:37,332
<i>Even Heimdall's son,</i>

1689
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:39,167
<i>Axl Heimdallson,</i>

1690

1691
01:45:41,628 --> 01:45:43,588
<i>was becoming quite the warrior.</i>

1692
01:45:43,672 --> 01:45:46,091
<i>The future of Asgard was secure.</i>

1693
01:45:47,634 --> 01:45:50,595
<i>Speaking of futures,</i>
<i>I was forging one of my own,</i>

1694
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:52,431
<i>now that my body's grown back,</i>

1695
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:55,350
<i>with a dude I met called Dwayne.</i>

1696
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:58,770
<i>And what about Thor, you ask?</i>

1697
01:45:59,521 --> 01:46:01,565
<i>He embarked on a new journey</i>

1698
01:46:01,648 --> 01:46:03,817
<i>because he had found</i>
<i>something to live for,</i>

1699
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,194
<i>something to love for.</i>

1700
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:07,863
<i>A little someone who turned him</i>

1701
01:46:07,946 --> 01:46:10,824
<i>from Sad God into Dad God.</i>

1702
01:46:10,907 --> 01:46:13,535
Breakfast is served.
Bon appétit.

1703
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:15,704
Hello. There you go.

1704
01:46:15,787 --> 01:46:16,913
Hey. Breakfast.

1705
01:46:17,706 --> 01:46:20,667
Excuse me. What is that?

1706
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:22,669
They're pan-flaps. From Earth.

1707
01:46:22,753 --> 01:46:24,671
I don't think I like pan-flaps.

1708
01:46:24,755 --> 01:46:25,922
- You love them.
- No, I don't.

1709
01:46:26,006 --> 01:46:27,924
- Yes, you do.
- I've never had that in my life.

1710
01:46:28,008 --> 01:46:29,676
Come on. Eat up. We have to go.
We're gonna be late.

1711
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,594
Now where are your boots?

1712
01:46:30,677 --> 01:46:32,804
I'm wearing them.

1713
01:46:32,888 --> 01:46:34,431
You're not wearing those.

1714
01:46:34,514 --> 01:46:36,183
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1715
01:46:36,266 --> 01:46:37,517
Yes, I am.

1716
01:46:37,601 --> 01:46:38,727
No. You're not.

1717
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:39,936
Go to hell, demon!

1718
01:46:41,897 --> 01:46:42,773
Wow!

1719
01:46:42,856 --> 01:46:45,859
Brand new, now destroyed.
Thank you very much.

1720
01:46:45,942 --> 01:46:48,111
You know what? You wear what you want.

1721
01:46:48,195 --> 01:46:49,196
Don't come complaining to me

1722
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:50,322
when your feet get sore, all right?

1723
01:46:50,405 --> 01:46:52,157
You'll get no sympathy here from me.

1724
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:54,326
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

1725
01:46:54,409 --> 01:46:55,243
Thank you.

1726
01:46:55,327 --> 01:46:57,412
Remember what my mother used to tell me.

1727
01:46:57,496 --> 01:46:58,497
Listen to the grown-ups,

1728
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,540
and if you see anyone scared
or being picked on,

1729
01:47:00,624 --> 01:47:02,042
- you look after them, okay?
- Okay.

1730
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:03,877
And most of all, have fun.

1731
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,420
- Gotcha.
- Gotcha.

1732
01:47:05,504 --> 01:47:07,464
Now where is Mjolnir?
Where did I put him?

1733
01:47:07,547 --> 01:47:08,590
Over there. Sleeping in the bed.

1734
01:47:08,673 --> 01:47:09,925
In the bed.

1735
01:47:11,718 --> 01:47:12,719
Oh, wow.

1736
01:47:15,222 --> 01:47:16,765
That is not coming off.

1737
01:47:17,849 --> 01:47:19,226
What did you do?

1738
01:47:19,309 --> 01:47:21,019
Eh, she looked boring before.

1739
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:24,064
Yeah. Suppose it did.

1740
01:47:24,147 --> 01:47:25,398
I love it.

1741
01:47:25,482 --> 01:47:26,775
Very creative.

1742
01:47:30,654 --> 01:47:31,655
Okay.

1743
01:47:31,738 --> 01:47:33,532
Now, you see the aliens down there?

1744
01:47:33,615 --> 01:47:35,117
The stripy ones?

1745
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,618
- They look nice.
- Yeah, they are nice.

1746
01:47:36,701 --> 01:47:37,994
That's why we have to look after them.

1747
01:47:38,078 --> 01:47:39,871
Got it. Protect the nice ones.

1748
01:47:40,789 --> 01:47:41,998
I love you, sweetie.

1749
01:47:42,082 --> 01:47:43,416
Love you, Uncle Thor.

1750
01:47:46,461 --> 01:47:48,004
<i>They will always be there for us.</i>

1751
01:47:48,088 --> 01:47:51,383
<i>The Space Viking and his girl,</i>
<i>born from Eternity.</i>

1752
01:47:51,466 --> 01:47:53,760
<i>With the powers of a god.</i>

1753
01:47:56,263 --> 01:47:57,639
<i>Two warriors</i>

1754
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,599
<i>fighting the good fight</i>

1755
01:47:59,683 --> 01:48:01,143
<i>for those who can't fight good.</i>

1756
01:48:07,023 --> 01:48:08,483
<i>They have travelled far,</i>

1757
01:48:08,567 --> 01:48:10,193
<i>and have been given many names.</i>

1758
01:48:11,319 --> 01:48:13,655
<i>But to those who know them best,</i>

1759
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:15,448
<i>they are simply known</i>

1760
01:48:15,532 --> 01:48:17,367
<i>as Love and Thunder.</i>

1761
01:50:05,433 --> 01:50:08,061
It used to be that being a god,

1762
01:50:08,144 --> 01:50:09,562
it meant something.

1763
01:50:11,356 --> 01:50:12,983
People would whisper your name

1764
01:50:13,984 --> 01:50:17,487
before sharing their deepest
hopes and dreams.

1765
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:20,907
They begged you for mercy

1766
01:50:21,908 --> 01:50:24,327
without ever knowing if
you were actually listening.

1767
01:50:27,038 --> 01:50:28,039
Now,

1768
01:50:28,748 --> 01:50:30,500
you know, they look to the sky,

1769
01:50:31,459 --> 01:50:33,336
they don't ask us for lightning.

1770
01:50:34,379 --> 01:50:36,339
They don't ask us for rain.

1771
01:50:37,382 --> 01:50:41,344
They just want to see one of
their so-called superheroes.

1772
01:50:45,015 --> 01:50:47,058
When did we become the joke?

1773
01:50:50,478 --> 01:50:51,479
No.

1774
01:50:52,772 --> 01:50:53,815
No more.

1775
01:50:55,775 --> 01:50:57,944
They will fear us again

1776
01:50:58,695 --> 01:51:01,406
when Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

1777
01:51:04,951 --> 01:51:07,787
Do you understand me, Hercules?

1778
01:51:08,371 --> 01:51:10,832
Do you understand me, my son?

1779
01:51:10,915 --> 01:51:12,709
Yes, Father.

1780
01:57:54,694 --> 01:57:55,695
Huh?

1781
01:58:00,074 --> 01:58:01,075
What?

1782
01:58:01,993 --> 01:58:03,327
Oh. Hey.

1783
01:58:05,037 --> 01:58:06,539
Jane Foster.

1784
01:58:07,415 --> 01:58:08,624
