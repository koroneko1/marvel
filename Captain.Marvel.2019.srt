1
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,755
Do you know what time it is?

2
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Can't sleep.

3
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,438
There are tabs for that.

4
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,633
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.

5
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,714
Dreams again?

6
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,560
Wanna fight?

7
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
I slipped.

8
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,350
Right, you slipped

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,120
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

10
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
I was already slipping

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,376
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

12
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,914
The two events
were not related.

13
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Tell me about this dream.

14
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,676
- Anything new?
- No.

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,480
You have to let go
of the past.

16
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,790
I don't remember my past.

17
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,474
It's causing you doubt,

18
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,313
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

19
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,556
Control it.

20
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,312
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
with the Supreme Intelligence.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,834
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

23
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,952
Humor is a distraction.

24
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,119
And anger?

25
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,759
Anger only serves the enemy.

26
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,536
<i>One hundred twenty days</i>

27
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,438
<i>since the last Skrull attack.</i>

28
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
<i>Has anyone ever seen</i>

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,776
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,440
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,840
in its true form.

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,154
You know that.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,469
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

34
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,917
So it's sacred. It's personal.

35
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,912
No Kree divulges it, ever.

36
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Who do you see?

37
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
- Your brother?
- No.

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,635
- Father?
- No.

39
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,837
- Your old commander?
- Vers.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,229
It's me you see, isn't it?

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
I see
what you're trying to do.

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,674
- Is it working?
- Yes.

43
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,640
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,990
What is the point of
giving me these...

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,879
if you don't want me
to use them?

46
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,713
I want you to use them.

47
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,736
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,558
of showing you
how to use them.

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
I know how.

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,896
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

51
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,000
knock me down without them.

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,676
Control your impulses.

53
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,116
Stop using this,
start using this.

54
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,874
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,070
Vers.

56
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,633
Intelligence.

57
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,953
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

58
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,156
I am.

59
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,679
You struggle
with your emotions...

60
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,669
with your past,
which fuels them.

61
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,433
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

62
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,672
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

63
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,753
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

64
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,912
then take over our planets.

65
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,393
Horrors that you remember...

66
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,120
and so much that you do not.

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,430
It's all blank.
My life.

68
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,159
You're supposed
to take the form

69
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,913
of who I most admire...

70
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,438
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

71
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,632
Perhaps this is a mercy

72
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,030
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

73
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,519
Freeing you
to do what all Kree must...

74
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,830
put your people's needs
before your own.

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,396
We've given you a great gift.

76
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,075
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

77
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,676
I want to serve.

78
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,792
Then master yourself.

79
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,555
What was given
can be taken away.

80
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,996
I won't let you down.

81
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,197
We'll know soon enough.

82
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,274
You have a mission.

83
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,115
Serve well, and with honor.

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,474
This can't be good.

85
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,472
Must be another Skrull attack.

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,114
Whatever it is, it's big.

87
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,355
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

88
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,556
Once.

89
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,871
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?

90
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,271
Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy...

91
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,318
and the face staring back
was my own.

92
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,976
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,354
then it would be
less disturbing.

94
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,477
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

95
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,790
You never laugh.

96
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,429
I laugh on the inside.

97
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,110
I'm not doing that now.

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,456
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

99
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,596
you're quite handsome.

100
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,830
Well, thank you.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,071
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

102
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,556
All right.

103
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,391
Prepare for...

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,074
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

105
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,472
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

106
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,438
This time, Torfa.

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

108
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,117
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

109
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,473
The Skrull general, Talos,

110
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,233
has sent kill units
to find him.

111
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,959
Should they reach him
before we do...

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,320
the intelligence he's acquired

113
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,079
over three years
is as good as theirs.

114
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,920
The Accusers will bomb

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,957
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

116
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,874
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,433
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

118
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,199
The Torfan populace.

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,280
We are not to interfere
with them,

120
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,390
nor them with us.

121
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,837
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,673
Proceed with caution.

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,231
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

124
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,394
This is a dangerous mission.

125
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,394
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

126
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,880
if that is our fate today.

127
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
For the good of all Kree.

128
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,440
For the good of all Kree!

129
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,949
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,120
Locals on the periphery.

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,195
Maybe a dozen.

133
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,016
Minn-Erva?

134
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,080
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Repeat.

136
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

137
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,550
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

138
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,016
Only one way in,
only one way out.

139
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,520
We can get past the locals.

140
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,275
We don't know
if they are locals. Too risky.

141
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,656
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

142
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
No, you won't.

143
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,712
Right. We keep a close radius.

144
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,917
We lose comms,
we meet back at the <i>Helion.</i>

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,195
Come on.

146
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,794
Att-Lass, you getting this?

147
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,360
Copy. I see them.

148
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,550
Get back!

149
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Commander?

150
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,116
Get back! Back!

151
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,520
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

152
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,154
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

153
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,553
Does anybody copy?

154
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't wanna hurt you.

155
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,790
Keep back!

156
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Stay back!

157
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,836
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

158
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,633
They're just starving.

159
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,720
HGX-78.

160
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,634
TRT79-VVX6.

161
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,158
Get back.

162
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Skrulls!

163
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Vers!

164
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,397
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>

165
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,392
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

166
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,396
Incoming!

167
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,034
Back to the <i>Helion.</i>

168
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,600
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>

169
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,152
<i>Back to the</i> Helion.

170
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,470
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

171
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,279
How did you know the code?

172
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,350
How about
I tell you my secret...

173
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,390
when you've told me yours?

174
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,434
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

175
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,836
<i>Where are we?</i>

176
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,400
<i>Stand by.</i>

177
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,390
Where's your head at?

178
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,636
In the clouds. Where's yours?

179
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,354
On my shoulders.

180
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,079
About to show these boys
how we do it.

181
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,640
You ready?

182
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,776
Higher, further, faster, baby.

183
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
That's right.

184
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,194
<i>This can't be right.</i>

185
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,439
<i>Go back even further.</i>

186
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,119
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

187
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,155
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>

188
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,416
What the hell
are you thinking?

189
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,480
You don't belong out here!

190
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,080
<i>I think
we went back too far.</i>

191
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,474
You let him drive.

192
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,994
<i>Let me try something.</i>

193
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,600
Give up already!

194
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,399
You don't belong out here!

195
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,875
You're not strong enough.

196
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,394
You'll kill yourself.

197
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,754
They'll never let you fly.

198
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,270
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>

199
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,557
You're a decent pilot.

200
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
But you're too emotional.

201
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,594
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

202
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,312
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

203
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,479
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

204
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,676
And so,

205
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,520
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

206
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,396
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

207
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,911
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

208
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,276
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

209
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,556
<i>Charming memory.</i>

210
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
<i>Hang on.</i>

211
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,280
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,400
Goose likes you.

213
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,000
She doesn't typically
take to people.

214
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,440
Early start to your morning.

215
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,750
Uh, late night, actually.

216
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,832
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Sound familiar?

218
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,760
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

219
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,760
Wonderful view, isn't it?

220
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,632
I prefer the view
from up there.

221
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,096
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

222
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,191
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.</i>

223
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,999
<i>Stand by.</i>

224
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,835
Sound familiar?

225
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,520
Wonderful view, isn't it?

226
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,399
I prefer the view
from up there.

227
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,816
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

228
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,936
<i>What's that on her shirt?</i>

229
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,235
<i>I couldn't read it.</i>

230
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,592
Wonderful view, isn't it?

231
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,953
I prefer the view
from up there.

232
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,876
<i>- Focus.</i>
- Excuse me?

233
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,679
<i>Look down.</i>

234
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,758
<i>Focus.</i>

235
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,560
<i>"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.</i>

236
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Do you hear that, too?

237
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,240
<i>Do we have
her location?</i>

238
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
<i>Got it.</i>

239
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,315
<i>Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.</i>

240
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,273
<i>Interesting.</i>

241
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,837
<i>Huh. Hold on.</i>

242
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,154
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>

243
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,430
That's no MiG, Lawson.

244
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,910
<i>This is it. Now let me
see where you're headed.</i>

245
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,596
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

246
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,680
<i>Focus.</i>

247
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,874
<i>Open, please.</i>

248
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,515
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

249
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,909
<i>You're almost there.</i>

250
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,593
<i>You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>

251
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,509
<i>Focus!</i>

252
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,919
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>

253
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,909
This doesn't make any sense.

254
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,471
Do we have any information
we can act on?

255
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,875
Just that Lawson was somewhere
on planet C-53.

256
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
We're on our way.

257
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,953
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

258
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,238
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

259
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,874
And everything we're after.

260
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Oh!

261
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,755
That did something.

262
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,195
Try that again.

263
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Not yet!

264
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,800
What did you do to me?

265
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,318
Now we're just after
a little information.

266
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,960
What did you put in my head?

267
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,998
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

268
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,955
But those aren't my memories.

269
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,635
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

270
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,996
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

271
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,231
They really did
a number on you.

272
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,480
Enough of your mind games.

273
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,120
What do you want?

274
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,675
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

275
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,399
and her light-speed engine.

276
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,233
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

277
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,916
Really?
Then why is she in your head?

278
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,016
You guys
wouldn't happen to know

279
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,440
how these things come off,
would ya?

280
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
No?

281
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,069
Fine.

282
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Hmm.

283
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,916
Hey.

284
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,280
<i>You do
know why they call it a...</i>

285
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,795
You leaving so soon?

286
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,280
We're just getting to know
each other.

287
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,673
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

288
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,515
Hello? Do you copy?

289
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,872
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

290
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,190
Is this C-53?

291
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,360
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

292
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,512
Yeah. I understand you.

293
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,990
Oh, good.

294
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,080
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

295
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,554
Sort of. Uh, the movie theater
has its own guy.

296
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,918
Where can I find
communications equipment?

297
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,156
Thank you.

298
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,197
Track the pod. Find the girl.

299
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,755
She knows more than she knows.

300
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,150
Hey.

301
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,794
This one's taken.

302
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,595
Come on.

303
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,156
<i>Vers?</i>

304
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,430
Vers?

305
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,078
Verify. CTC-39.

306
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,430
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>

307
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,960
<i>And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.</i>

308
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,320
<i>Is everyone okay?
What happened?</i>

309
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,278
Skrull ambush.

310
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,999
I thought we'd lost you.

311
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Did you find Soh-Larr?

312
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,555
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>

313
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,632
<i>Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.</i>

314
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,957
That's impossible.

315
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,952
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

316
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,395
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.

317
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,720
The machine that they used...

318
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,640
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

319
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Vers, where are you?

320
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,840
<i>I'm on planet C-53.</i>

321
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,950
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

322
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,474
<i>Who?</i>

323
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,758
She's who I see.

324
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,559
<i>She's what?</i>

325
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,555
<i>Vers?</i>

326
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Vers, what?

327
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,269
She's a scientist.

328
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,416
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

329
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,033
I have to get to her
before they do...

330
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,776
<i>or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>

331
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,553
No. You've been
caught once already.

332
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,314
How far is C-53?

333
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,475
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.

334
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,760
<i>Vers, hold your
position until we get there.</i>

335
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,752
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>

336
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,798
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

337
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,976
<i>We're sorry.</i>

338
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,096
<i>A long-distance
company access code</i>

339
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,176
<i>is required for the number
you have dialed.</i>

340
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,839
- Yon-Rogg?
- Vers?

341
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Vers?

342
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,856
<i>Please dial your call
with the access code.</i>

343
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Vers?

344
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,640
If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

345
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,792
She's stronger than you think.

346
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,597
Ever been to C-53?

347
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,350
Once.

348
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,231
It's a real shithole.

349
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,599
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

350
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,234
Did you call this in?

351
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,240
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

352
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,720
Excuse me, miss.

353
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,270
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

354
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,592
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

355
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,400
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

356
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,910
Oh.

357
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,237
Yeah, I think
she went that way.

358
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,952
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

359
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,115
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

360
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,273
Could I see
some identification, please?

361
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,194
Vers. Kree Starforce.

362
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,416
We don't carry
our identification

363
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
on little cards.

364
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Vers?

365
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,113
Starforce?

366
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,914
How long you plan
to be in town?

367
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,280
oh, I'll be
out of your hair...

368
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,616
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

369
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,359
that are infiltrating
your planet.

370
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,550
Skrulls?

371
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,150
Shapeshifters?

372
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,358
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

373
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

374
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,838
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

375
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,120
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

376
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,078
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

377
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,152
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

378
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,279
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

379
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,557
You're under arrest.

380
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,595
Rook!

381
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,709
Rook, let's roll!

382
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,556
Did you see her weapon?

383
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,757
I did not.

384
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,916
Watch it!

385
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,955
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

386
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,754
"Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

387
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,911
"Trust me, true believer."

388
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
Get off!

389
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,553
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

390
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,557
Let's greet them
at the station.

391
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,117
<i>Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.</i>

392
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,152
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

393
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,560
And, uh, where'd everybody go?

394
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,992
<i>I finished
collecting evidence...</i>

395
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,469
We need an ambulance!

396
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,835
Someone call 911!

397
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,480
Hey! You all right?

398
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,478
Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?

399
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Anyone else see that?

400
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,753
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

401
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,119
Nice scuba suit.

402
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,472
Lighten up, honey, huh?

403
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,472
Got a smile for me?

404
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,870
Freak.

405
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,671
All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

406
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,470
Whatever he runs on,

407
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,835
it's not
on the periodic table.

408
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,595
You're saying
he's not from around here?

409
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,670
Hey, how's your eye?

410
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,831
Well, I'd say fine...

411
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,430
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

412
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,109
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

413
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,118
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

414
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,000
And the woman said
that there were more?

415
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,072
The word she used
was "infiltration."

416
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,276
You believe her?

417
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,999
Not till I saw this.

418
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,275
What's your plan?

419
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,718
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

420
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,031
I got word
on a motorcycle thief

421
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,474
that fits her description.

422
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,350
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

423
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,077
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

424
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Good.

425
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,035
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

426
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,192
Not even our own men.

427
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,589
Yes, sir.

428
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,839
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

429
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,790
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

430
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,075
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

431
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,913
I will finish what we started.

432
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,512
I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

433
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,239
No one in or out.

434
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,076
Boom!

435
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,476
What can I get ya?

436
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,400
Where was
this photograph taken?

437
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,430
An airport.

438
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,829
Where's Pegasus?

439
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,593
That's classified.

440
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,312
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

441
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,511
But I see you've changed it up
a bit since then.

442
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,319
Grunge is a good look for you.

443
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,994
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

444
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,594
It was cool, you know?

445
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,559
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

446
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,191
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

447
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,234
Typical nine-to-five.

448
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
So you saw one?

449
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,314
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

450
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,237
but I can't unsee that.

451
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,035
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

452
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,510
You think I'm one of those
green things.

453
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,955
Can't be too careful.

454
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,876
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

455
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,355
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

456
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,477
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

457
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,359
No. The DNA would match.

458
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,596
Want my AOL password?

459
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,757
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

460
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,832
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

461
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,560
You wanna get personal.

462
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,760
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

463
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,376
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

464
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,976
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.

465
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,336
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.

466
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Do I pass?

467
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,794
Not yet. First job?

468
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,713
Soldier.
Straight out of high school.

469
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,096
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

470
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,156
- Then?
- Spy.

471
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,456
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.

472
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,630
We were everywhere.

473
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,474
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

474
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,120
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

475
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,430
- Now?
- Been riding a desk

476
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
for the past six years...

477
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,736
trying to figure out
where our

478
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,816
future enemies
are coming from.

479
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,990
Never occurred to me

480
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,356
they would be coming
from above.

481
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,840
Name a detail so bizarre

482
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,240
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

483
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,310
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

484
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,674
You didn't need that, did you?

485
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,513
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

486
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,753
Okay. Your turn.

487
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,599
Prove you're not a Skrull.

488
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,760
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

489
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,035
you're not a Skrull?

490
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,475
That's a photon blast.

491
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,910
And?

492
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
A Skrull can't do that.

493
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,236
So, a full bird colonel

494
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,656
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

495
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,115
must have pretty high
security clearance.

496
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,750
Where's Pegasus?

497
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,353
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

498
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,193
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

499
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,400
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

500
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,075
Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

501
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,836
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

502
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,952
They believe
that she developed

503
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,872
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.

504
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,599
Light-speed engine?

505
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,000
Gotta admit, that's not

506
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,480
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

507
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,119
Well, it's still early.

508
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,192
And you, what do you want?

509
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,676
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

510
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
And?

511
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,231
Look, war is
a universal language.

512
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,120
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

513
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,511
You got a personal stake
in this.

514
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,376
<i>This is government property.</i>

515
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,232
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>

516
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,438
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

517
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,791
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

518
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,115
<i>One moment.</i>

519
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,236
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

520
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,394
Everybody calls me Fury.

521
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,440
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

522
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,080
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.

523
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,680
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

524
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,876
What about your kids?

525
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,793
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

526
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,256
<i>You are cleared for access.</i>

527
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Thank you.

528
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,515
Oh, hold up.

529
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,714
You look like
somebody's disaffected niece.

530
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Put that on.

531
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,158
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

532
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,994
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

533
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,560
help with
the covert part of your job?

534
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,996
Said the space soldier
who was wearing a rubber suit.

535
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,230
Lose the flannel.

536
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,680
How can I help you?

537
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,352
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

538
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,757
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

539
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,151
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

540
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,234
Do you know her?

541
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,749
Follow me.

542
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Hmm.

543
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,392
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

544
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
No.

545
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,990
Well, this ain't it.

546
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,350
Is that a communicator?

547
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,837
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

548
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,070
Who are you paging?

549
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,916
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

550
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
After you.

551
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,359
Impressive.

552
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,194
Oh, you should see what I can
do with a paperclip.

553
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,196
Hey, there. How are you?

554
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,794
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

555
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,396
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

556
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,791
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

557
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
What's your name?

558
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,839
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

559
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
Fury?

560
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Hmm?

561
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,720
I'll be back.

562
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,157
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

563
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,834
Just let me unravel
this puppy.

564
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,430
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

565
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,736
When all you had to do was...

566
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,274
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

567
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,431
Huh. Lawson.

568
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,632
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

569
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,560
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

570
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,552
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.

571
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,310
Kree glyphs?

572
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,830
Hmm?

573
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,793
Lawson is not cuckoo.

574
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,753
She's Kree.

575
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,350
Well, she's dead.

576
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,994
What?

577
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,833
She crashed the Asis aircraft

578
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,798
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

579
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,957
Took a pilot down with her.

580
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,271
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

581
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,512
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

582
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,800
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

583
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,840
When did this crash happen?

584
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,678
Six years ago. 1989.

585
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,274
Who was the pilot?

586
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,272
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

587
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,559
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

588
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,797
Last person to see them alive.

589
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,310
You okay?

590
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,270
Mm-hmm.

591
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,155
Back in a minute.

592
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,118
This isn't about
fighting wars.

593
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,034
It's about ending them.

594
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,600
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>

595
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,679
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

596
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,520
<i>Do you know anything
about this?</i>

597
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,239
I just discovered
a mission report

598
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,959
sent from C-53.

599
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,156
There's only so much

600
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,880
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

601
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,714
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

602
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,476
She was working
on a unique energy core.

603
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,960
Experimenting with tech

604
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,874
that apparently could help us
win the war.

605
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,870
She still here?

606
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,475
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

607
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,637
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.

608
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,677
I want to question her alone.

609
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,630
Excellent work, Nicholas.

610
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,158
Does it say anything about me?

611
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,999
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

612
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,196
<i>Why would it?</i>

613
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,478
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

614
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,279
<i>On C-53?</i>

615
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,080
Mar-Vell is who I see

616
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,640
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

617
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,878
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

618
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,271
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

619
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,238
No, it's not. Because I
remember. I was here.

620
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,153
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

621
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,551
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

622
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,071
<i>Do not let your emotions
override yourjudgment.</i>

623
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,233
She's on sublevel six.

624
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,800
I'll get off on five...

625
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,077
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

626
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,119
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

627
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,319
Right. Like we did in Havana.

628
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,416
<i>We're nearing
the jump point.</i>

629
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,079
<i>Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.</i>

630
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,990
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

631
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,799
Together.

632
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,640
Okay.

633
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,840
Vers!

634
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,789
Vers!

635
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,279
Fury's colluding
with the target.

636
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,715
Then why would he call us in?

637
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,315
All I know is we take
him in, too. Dead or alive.

638
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,800
Dead or alive?

639
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,915
Go. Go, go!

640
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,517
Was it something I said?

641
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,596
Mmm-mmm.

642
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,080
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

643
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,674
but they do
kinda complete the look.

644
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,589
Don't you think?

645
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
You called them in?

646
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,760
My bad.

647
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,833
Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

648
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,639
They're not down here.

649
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,116
Let's try up there.

650
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,635
- What?
- Your communicator.

651
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,553
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

652
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,079
Do you know
how to fly this thing?

653
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,240
Uh, we'll see.

654
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,914
That's a yes or no question.

655
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
Yes.

656
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,040
That's what I'm talking about!

657
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,635
We got a stowaway.

658
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,830
Hang on, Goose.

659
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,040
Goose.

660
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,276
No, Goose.

661
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,752
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

662
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,879
Yes, that's right.

663
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,872
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

664
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,560
You the good kitty,
that's right.

665
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,790
See anyone you know?

666
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,074
Funny story.

667
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,916
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

668
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,870
That was six years ago.

669
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,191
So, you think you're the pilot

670
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,480
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

671
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,030
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

672
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,120
could probably tell us.

673
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,873
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,793
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?

675
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,240
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

676
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,678
That agent...

677
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,752
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

678
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,832
Coulson. The new guy.

679
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,275
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.

680
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,193
Yeah, well, give him time.

681
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,793
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

682
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,151
Went with his gut
against orders.

683
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,640
That's a really
hard thing to do.

684
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,718
But it's what keeps us human.

685
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,236
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

686
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,576
Oh, I can see that about you.

687
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,835
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

688
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,195
I'm guessing that's not

689
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,873
standard
Kree operating procedure.

690
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,197
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

691
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,480
Ronan.

692
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,518
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>

693
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,136
<i>but the greater mission
was a failure,</i>

694
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,276
<i>thanks to your team.</i>

695
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,920
It was a trap

696
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,640
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

697
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,029
<i>Give us their location.</i>

698
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,720
<i>We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.</i>

699
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,076
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

700
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,757
No, we'll handle this.

701
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,037
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i>

702
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,077
<i>is a threat
to Kree everywhere.</i>

703
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
<i>Where are they?</i>

704
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,079
- They are...
- Lost.

705
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,391
They are lost for now.

706
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,240
But we will find them.

707
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,951
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>

708
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,515
Maintain the course for C-53.

709
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,991
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

710
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,435
Auntie Carol?

711
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,512
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

712
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,229
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

713
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,471
But we knew they were lying.

714
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,757
I'm not really
who you think I am.

715
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,917
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

716
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,073
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

717
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,856
You are
absolutely right, young lady.

718
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,394
There is no such thing.

719
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,914
'Cause if there were,

720
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,469
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

721
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,710
You don't believe me?

722
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,949
No way!

723
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,278
That's so cool!

724
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,016
Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

725
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,156
with those hands.

726
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,356
Like what? Show us.

727
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,840
Maybe later.

728
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,309
I kept all your stuff.

729
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,670
I'll go get it.

730
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,239
You want to give her
a hand with that?

731
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,630
Hmm?

732
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,552
You don't remember anything?

733
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,317
I see flashes.

734
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,880
Little moments.

735
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,360
But I can't tell what's real.

736
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,957
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

737
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,790
maybe it'll all make sense.

738
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,110
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

739
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,839
Your usual move.

740
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,990
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

741
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,989
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

742
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,715
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

743
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,080
at doing something
that mattered.

744
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,920
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

745
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,136
and I wasn't about to argue,

746
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,958
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

747
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,237
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

748
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,959
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

749
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,216
Since it violates
the predetermined

750
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,240
rules of engagement.

751
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,656
I definitely
don't remember those.

752
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,353
Hmm. Of course you don't.

753
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,554
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

754
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,758
She said
she had lives to save.

755
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,176
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

756
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,236
but you said that...

757
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,956
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

758
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,399
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

759
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,953
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

760
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,476
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

761
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,317
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

762
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,560
I know
this must be hard for you.

763
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,672
Oh, what?
This part right here?

764
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,830
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

765
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,640
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

766
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,474
in a mission so secret

767
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,631
they act
like it never even happened.

768
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,231
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

769
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,198
too damn stubborn to die.

770
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,274
And now you come up in here
after six years...

771
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,318
with your supercharged
fire hands...

772
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,834
and you expect me
to call you...

773
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,273
I don't even know what. Vers?

774
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,997
Is that really
who you are now?

775
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,033
I don't know.

776
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,679
Come look!

777
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,673
This is me
and you on Halloween.

778
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,117
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

779
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,800
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

780
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,758
You didn't get along
with your parents...

781
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,479
so Mom said
we became your real family.

782
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,199
This is us on Christmas.

783
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,640
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

784
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,416
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

785
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,576
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

786
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,736
And this is right after
you graduated.

787
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,416
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

788
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,256
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

789
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,430
And this is you with Mom

790
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,856
right after a good day
of training.

791
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,216
These were
your three favorite guys.

792
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,749
Oh, wait. I forgot.

793
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,320
Your jacket.

794
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,874
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

795
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,553
after I spilled ketchup on it.

796
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,231
That was all
that survived the crash.

797
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,193
Or so we thought.

798
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,558
Don't answer that.

799
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,359
It's just my neighbor.

800
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,193
They can change into anyone.

801
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,520
Hi there.

802
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
What do you want?

803
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,033
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

804
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,634
This is my friend, Carol.

805
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,074
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

806
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,480
Yowzers.

807
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,836
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

808
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,274
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

809
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,560
and I was just wondering...

810
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,816
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

811
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,910
to get a closer look-see?

812
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,356
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

813
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,638
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

814
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,960
Mmm.

815
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,520
You're really working overtime

816
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,069
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

817
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,640
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

818
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,234
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

819
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,438
- Uh...
- Okay.

820
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,991
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

821
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,896
You never know
when you're gonna need

822
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,513
to borrow some sugar.

823
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,391
Now, hang on a second.

824
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,037
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

825
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,159
making a mess
of your friend's house...

826
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,195
It's a lovely home, miss.

827
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,556
Oh, my God!

828
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,639
What the hell?

829
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,834
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

830
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,876
Just don't kill me.

831
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,833
That would really complicate
the situation.

832
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,680
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

833
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,080
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

834
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,754
I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

835
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,556
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

836
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,756
Without deception.

837
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,229
And who is that out there?

838
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,430
Okay, that's a fair point...

839
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,319
but I'm sure
that you understand

840
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,551
I had to take
some precautions.

841
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,872
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

842
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,996
with your hands bound.

843
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,276
I just wanna talk.

844
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,480
Last time we talked,

845
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,816
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

846
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,309
That was before I knew
who you were.

847
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,598
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

848
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,751
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

849
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,879
of your voice
from a plane crash

850
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,394
six years ago...

851
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,759
on a device I believe you call
a "black box."

852
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,915
They told me it was destroyed
in the crash.

853
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,070
How'd you get it?

854
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,240
She don't understand.

855
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,856
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

856
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,314
that kind of allows me

857
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,437
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

858
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,800
Call me "young lady" again...

859
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,115
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

860
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,634
it's not supposed to be.

861
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,030
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

862
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,790
Your ass.

863
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,429
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

864
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,478
But, look,
I just need your help

865
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,755
decoding some coordinates.

866
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,760
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

867
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,118
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

868
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,031
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

869
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,640
Deal.

870
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,718
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

871
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,240
How'd that get in here?

872
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,436
Hmm?

873
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
The cat?

874
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,520
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

875
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,710
That's not a cat.

876
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,877
- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?

877
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,599
Mom?

878
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,080
Monica.

879
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,799
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

880
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,040
What's happening?

881
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,793
It's loading.

882
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,976
<i>Punch in the coordinates</i>

883
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,392
<i>5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8. 7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

884
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,517
<i>Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?</i>

885
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,034
<i>My laboratory.</i>

886
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,431
<i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>

887
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,716
<i>Oh, no.</i>

888
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,872
<i>Is that...
Wait, what is that?</i>

889
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,394
<i>It's not showing up
on my radar.</i>

890
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,119
<i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>

891
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,671
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

892
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,832
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

893
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,960
Yes, ma'am.

894
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,151
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

895
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,874
I never should have
brought you along.

896
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,080
Here come some G's.

897
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,359
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

898
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,029
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

899
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,076
Stay with me, Lawson!

900
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,816
<i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>

901
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,275
Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

902
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,000
<i>Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?</i>

903
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,311
Yeah! I copy.

904
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,080
Doc?

905
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,514
Your blood.

906
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,993
It's blue.

907
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,352
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

908
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,196
Help me out, will ya?

909
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,278
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

910
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,550
Lawson?

911
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,715
You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

912
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,955
To end wars?

913
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,750
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

914
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,440
Damn it!

915
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,037
My name is not Lawson.

916
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,518
My real name is Mar-Vell,

917
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,399
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

918
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,791
I would say
that you're delusional...

919
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,560
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

920
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,154
and your blood is blue.

921
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,875
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

922
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,872
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

923
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,155
any more regrets.

924
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,391
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

925
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,593
You gotta save 'em without me.

926
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,796
Save who? How?

927
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,839
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

928
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,320
What are you doing?

929
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,311
We have no interest
in hurting you.

930
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,034
No?

931
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,874
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

932
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,880
The energy core.

933
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,949
Where is it?

934
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,839
Pararescue's on the way.

935
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,558
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

936
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,520
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

937
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,716
No, wait!

938
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,514
You mean that energy core?

939
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,196
No!

940
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,191
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

941
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,360
Hold your fire.

942
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,238
There's nothing left.

943
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,073
The core has been destroyed.

944
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,672
She absorbed its power.

945
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,718
She's coming with us.

946
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,960
He lied to me.

947
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,557
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

948
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,189
Now, you understand.

949
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,869
What?
What do I understand now?

950
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,918
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

951
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,196
He killed her...

952
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,878
'cause she found out
that she was

953
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,192
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

954
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,316
No.

955
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,031
Your people are terrorists.

956
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,680
They kill innocents.

957
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,593
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

958
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,037
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

959
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,677
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

960
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,439
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

961
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,637
and they destroyed our planet.

962
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,350
And the handful of us
that are left

963
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,511
will be slaughtered next...

964
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,674
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

965
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,394
The core that she found

966
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,040
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

967
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,958
capable of carrying us
to safety.

968
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,080
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

969
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,910
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

970
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,269
wasn't to fight wars...

971
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,440
but to end them.

972
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:45,599
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

973
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,720
Well, I already destroyed it.

974
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,354
No, you destroyed the engine.

975
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,513
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

976
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,999
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

977
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,719
we can find it.

978
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,113
You'll use it to destroy us.

979
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,399
We just want a home.

980
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,840
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

981
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,832
Can't you see it now?

982
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,394
You're not one of them.

983
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,954
You don't know me.

984
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,789
You have no idea who I am.

985
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,151
I don't even know who I am!

986
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,750
You are Carol Danvers.

987
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,117
You are the woman
on that black box

988
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,760
risking her life
to do the right thing.

989
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,279
My best friend...

990
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,393
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

991
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,914
when no one else did.

992
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,635
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

993
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,077
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

994
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,312
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

995
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,480
You hear me?

996
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,673
Do you hear me?

997
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,952
Come here. Come here, girl.

998
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,040
I got you.

999
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,273
<i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1000
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,677
but you were our only lead.

1001
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,071
We discovered
that your energy signature

1002
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,914
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1003
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,592
Now we know why.

1004
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,400
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1005
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,239
I just need your help

1006
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,870
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1007
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,598
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1008
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,712
For orbital position
and velocity.

1009
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,553
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1010
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,909
'cause it's not on Earth.

1011
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,160
That was the location

1012
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,456
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1013
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,880
If we track its course,

1014
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,236
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1015
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,119
It's just basic physics.

1016
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
In orbit?

1017
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,079
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1018
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,476
I mean,
you're my science guy, right?

1019
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,669
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1020
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,435
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1021
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,313
Mmm. We're going to space?

1022
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,480
In what?

1023
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,416
A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1024
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,557
I can handle
the modifications.

1025
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,393
Mmm. Your science guy.

1026
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,879
Well, I could use a copilot.

1027
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,635
No. No, I can't.

1028
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,678
I can't leave Monica.

1029
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,639
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1030
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,237
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1031
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,352
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1032
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,556
and you used to do that.

1033
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,238
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1034
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,856
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1035
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,473
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1036
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,776
with
a technologically-superior

1037
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,800
foreign enemy.

1038
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,635
Correct?

1039
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,800
That's what I'm saying.

1040
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,155
- You have to go!
- Monica!

1041
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,456
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1042
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,640
in the history of missions...

1043
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,576
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1044
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,875
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i>
with me?

1045
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,600
What?

1046
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,976
I just think
you should consider...

1047
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,277
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1048
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,336
What's going on around here?

1049
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,360
I know, I know.

1050
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,960
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1051
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,236
Your mom's lucky.

1052
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,675
When they were
handing out kids,

1053
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,433
they gave her
the toughest one.

1054
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Lieutenant Trouble.

1055
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,559
You remembered.

1056
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,360
Is that mine?

1057
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,674
No, no.

1058
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,596
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1059
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,630
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1060
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,475
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1061
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,713
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1062
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,632
with any sense of style...

1063
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,990
Hmm?

1064
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,156
Whoa.

1065
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,915
No.

1066
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,240
Uh-uh.

1067
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,313
Definitely not.

1068
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,636
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1069
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,915
Hmm.

1070
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,873
How do I look?

1071
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,720
Fresh.

1072
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,829
What took you so long?

1073
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,911
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1074
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,996
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

1075
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,919
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1076
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,633
Okay, then let's do this.

1077
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,512
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1078
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,400
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1079
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,800
But you would never
tell me who.

1080
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,392
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1081
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,080
The transfusion.

1082
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,311
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1083
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,520
Whose blood?

1084
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,276
Hmm.

1085
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,680
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1086
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,680
What have you done with her?

1087
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,797
You're too late.

1088
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,470
She knows?

1089
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,437
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1090
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,600
Come at once.

1091
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,831
<i>For the good of all Kree,
Commander...</i>

1092
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,879
<i>the infestation
will be eradicated.</i>

1093
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,872
Passing 500 and climbing.

1094
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,237
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1095
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,598
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1096
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,480
And as long as he continues to
freak you out...

1097
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,790
like that...

1098
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,395
yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

1099
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,314
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1100
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,039
Can I ask you something?

1101
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,317
Do you just
turn into anything you want?

1102
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,153
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1103
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,390
Can you all do it?

1104
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,593
Physiologically? Yeah.

1105
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,911
But, uh, it takes practice...

1106
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,796
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1107
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,475
- Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?

1108
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,760
What about a filing cabinet?

1109
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,233
Why would I
turn into a filing cabinet?

1110
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,470
A Venus flytrap?

1111
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,736
I'll give you
50 bucks right now

1112
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,016
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1113
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,713
Switching engines

1114
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,076
from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

1115
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,240
Hey.

1116
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,909
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1117
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Pretty much.

1118
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,752
Locking in
on coordinate grid.

1119
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,555
Where is it?

1120
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,794
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1121
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:39,240
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

1122
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,752
<i>Decloaking activated.</i>

1123
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,559
Is that it? The core?

1124
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,996
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1125
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,230
Whoa.

1126
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,031
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1127
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:19,996
We're not alone.

1128
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,480
Talos!

1129
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,279
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1130
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,035
It's okay.

1131
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,639
We didn't know what to do.

1132
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,111
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1133
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,555
or the Kree would find us.

1134
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,117
You did the right thing.

1135
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,949
It's okay, it's okay.

1136
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,597
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1137
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,233
I am not gonna hurt you.

1138
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,438
She led me to you.

1139
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,674
I'm so sorry.

1140
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,629
I didn't know.

1141
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:00,836
Carol.

1142
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,637
This is war.

1143
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,837
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1144
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,393
But we're here now.

1145
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,838
You found my family.

1146
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,070
This is just the beginning.

1147
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,759
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1148
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,554
scattered throughout
the galaxy.

1149
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,556
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1150
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,632
I'd have
some high scores, too.

1151
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,556
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1152
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,756
Uh-uh.

1153
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,837
What did you do
to your uniform?

1154
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,992
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1155
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,976
The Supreme Intelligence will
set her straight.

1156
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,560
You can see
they're not soldiers.

1157
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,876
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1158
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,190
And the core?

1159
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,040
You lied to me.

1160
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,114
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1161
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,513
What's given
can be taken away.

1162
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,456
Back here! Move, move!

1163
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,949
Get over here. Get down!

1164
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,155
Let's go! Go, move!

1165
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,560
There she is.

1166
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:34,790
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1167
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,875
This jacket.

1168
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,512
It's killer, by the way.

1169
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,400
Oh.

1170
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,512
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1171
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,439
Let me out.

1172
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,954
No can do.

1173
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:52,230
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1174
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,153
With what exactly?

1175
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,640
Your power comes from us.

1176
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,553
You didn't give me
these powers.

1177
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,756
The blast did.

1178
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,256
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1179
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,400
to control them on your own.

1180
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,433
<i>Species: Flerken.</i>

1181
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,113
<i>High.</i>

1182
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,358
It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.

1183
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,480
<i>Species: human male.</i>

1184
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,871
<i>Low to none.</i>

1185
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,360
That thing's clearly busted.

1186
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,637
Load the Flerken
onto the <i>Helion.</i>

1187
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,397
Eject the others into space.

1188
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,317
You did good, Ace.

1189
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:45,960
Thanks to you...

1190
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,077
those insidious shapeshifters

1191
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,719
will threaten
our borders no more.

1192
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,111
I used to believe your lies...

1193
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,920
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1194
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,639
You're talking
about destroying them

1195
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,313
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1196
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,590
And neither will I.

1197
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,912
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1198
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,554
You stole me.

1199
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,440
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1200
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,398
It's cute how hard you try.

1201
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,193
But remember...

1202
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:23,715
without us...

1203
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,990
<i>Give it up, Carol.</i>

1204
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:27,909
<i>Stay down!</i>

1205
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,520
...you're weak.

1206
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,536
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

1207
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,960
You're flawed.

1208
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,920
<i>Are you trying
to kill yourself?</i>

1209
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,296
Helpless.

1210
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,776
<i>You're too emotional
and so weak.</i>

1211
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,440
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

1212
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,320
We saved you.

1213
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,096
<i>- Control it.
- I told you,</i>

1214
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,176
<i>- Carol.
- They'll never</i>

1215
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,256
<i>- let you fly.
- This ain't</i>

1216
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,456
<i>- a game for little girls.
- You kiss like a horse.</i>

1217
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,536
<i>You won't last
a week, Danvers.</i>

1218
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,752
Without us, you're only human.

1219
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,469
You're right.

1220
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,837
I'm only human.

1221
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,157
On Hala, you were reborn...

1222
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,674
Vers.

1223
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,593
My name is Carol.

1224
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,953
She's trying to break out.

1225
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,597
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1226
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,119
But what happens when...

1227
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,317
I'm finally set free?

1228
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,360
You know you're glowing,
right?

1229
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,640
I'll explain it later.

1230
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,390
Take the Tesseract.

1231
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,676
Leave the lunchbox.

1232
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,354
- Me?
- Yes.

1233
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,840
I'm not touching that thing.

1234
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,440
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1235
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,155
Whoa!

1236
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,269
Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.

1237
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,591
Take the Flerken with you.

1238
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,999
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!

1239
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,752
I'm picking you up now.

1240
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,190
I'm trusting you
not to eat me.

1241
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,600
Oh, hey, guys.

1242
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,153
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1243
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,158
I used to find you amusing.

1244
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,880
Let's put an end to this.

1245
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,320
Okay.

1246
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,949
Good kitty.

1247
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,193
You knew all along.

1248
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,520
Is that why we never hung out?

1249
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,756
No, I just never liked you.

1250
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Incoming!

1251
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,520
Hey, in a hurry?

1252
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,513
Don't make me do this.

1253
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,760
Okay.

1254
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,636
Come on, do your thing!

1255
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:52,910
Come on!

1256
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,674
Come on!

1257
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,160
Damn it, Goose.

1258
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,390
Pick a side.

1259
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,478
Take them to the hangar, too.

1260
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,438
We'll blast them all
into space.

1261
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:13,520
Play it cool.

1262
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,354
Just like Havana.

1263
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:20,277
Do you have the thing?

1264
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,999
Flerken kitty ate it.

1265
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,760
Come on, move!

1266
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,070
Move!

1267
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:39,955
Follow my lead.

1268
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,000
Cover her eyes.

1269
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,960
Onto the ship!

1270
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,873
Let's go! Let's go!

1271
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,752
Nice diversion.

1272
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,873
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1273
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,997
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1274
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,230
On it.

1275
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,036
You all right, friend?

1276
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,032
Never better.

1277
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,638
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1278
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,159
Yes! Boom!

1279
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,355
Whoo!

1280
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,040
What the hell was that?

1281
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,557
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1282
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,240
That's impossible.

1283
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,790
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1284
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,475
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1285
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,429
That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1286
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,070
Take her down.

1287
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:38,076
Whoo!

1288
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,558
Return to the jump point.

1289
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,757
We'll be back for the weapon.

1290
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:35,509
The core?

1291
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,640
The woman.

1292
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,240
I'm so proud of you.

1293
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,594
You've come a long way

1294
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,637
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1295
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,317
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1296
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,596
long enough to take me on?

1297
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:41,434
Or will they get the better
of you as always?

1298
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,639
I always told you...

1299
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,115
you'll be ready

1300
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,510
the day you can knock me down
as yourself.

1301
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,160
This is that moment.

1302
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,835
This is that moment, Vers!

1303
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,070
Turn off the light show...

1304
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:57,597
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1305
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,117
I have nothing
to prove to you.

1306
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,997
<i>Destination: Hala.</i>

1307
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,799
I can't go back empty-handed.

1308
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,713
You won't be empty-handed.

1309
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,156
I'm sending you
with a message.

1310
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:42,518
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1311
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,434
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1312
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,680
You can't do this.

1313
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:11,156
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1314
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,776
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1315
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:14,870
Ow!

1316
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,189
Mother Flerken!

1317
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,430
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1318
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,434
It's just a scratch.

1319
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,115
No.

1320
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,512
I can't believe

1321
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,056
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1322
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,480
and I missed it.

1323
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,233
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1324
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,437
Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1325
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,640
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1326
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,479
I'll consider it...

1327
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:44,633
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1328
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,995
How's your eye?

1329
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,197
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1330
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,555
Just so I'm clear...

1331
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,120
you were Soh-Larr...

1332
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,317
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.

1333
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:56,150
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1334
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,154
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1335
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:00,595
It is a little like stealing.

1336
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,035
Whose side are you on here?

1337
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,016
You're good to go here
until you recover...

1338
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:07,078
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1339
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,833
I could go back
to being your boss.

1340
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Uh, please don't.

1341
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,994
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1342
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:15,516
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1343
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,677
Don't ever change your eyes.

1344
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,296
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1345
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,959
I was trying
not to panic...

1346
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:22,594
I'll help you find a home.

1347
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,840
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1348
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,076
They can stay here
with us.

1349
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,839
Can't they, Mom?

1350
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,912
They won't be safe here, baby.

1351
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,079
Auntie Carol's right.

1352
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,240
They need their own home.

1353
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,238
I'll be back
before you know it.

1354
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,997
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1355
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,959
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1356
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:47,520
Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.

1357
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,319
- You don't know.
- He doesn't.

1358
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,515
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1359
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,240
Hidden.

1360
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,437
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1361
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,190
Mar-Vell.

1362
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,635
That's what I said.

1363
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,156
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1364
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:12,640
Mar-Vell.

1365
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,976
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1366
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,275
You know,
like the Marvelettes.

1367
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,236
Not ringing any bells?

1368
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:32,193
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1369
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:49,074
I upgraded it.

1370
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,149
Range should be
a couple galaxies, at least.

1371
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,991
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1372
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:00,710
For emergencies only, okay?

1373
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,437
Well...

1374
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,391
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1375
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:12,637
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1376
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,672
Oh!

1377
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,437
We got
the ketchup stain off.

1378
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,633
Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.

1379
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,869
Hmm.

1380
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:50,555
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1381
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,390
Go on.

1382
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:15,194
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1383
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,349
So, is it true?

1384
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:23,816
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1385
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,230
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1386
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,830
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1387
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,190
Understood.

1388
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,720
I'm sorry to report

1389
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,976
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1390
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,196
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1391
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,519
I'll let you know
when it does.

1392
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,080
Then what?

1393
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:44,600
Sir?

1394
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,116
We have no idea

1395
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:49,238
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1396
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,392
And our one-woman
security force

1397
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,755
had a prior commitment...

1398
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,673
on the other side
of the universe.

1399
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,557
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.

1400
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,839
We need to find more.

1401
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,120
More weapons?

1402
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:05,913
More heroes.

1403
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,719
You think you can find
others like her?

1404
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,793
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1405
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,200
Get some rest, sir.

1406
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,112
You got
a big decision to make.

1407
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,913
This is a nightmare.

1408
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,836
I've had better nightmares.

1409
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,036
Hey.

1410
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:27,191
So, that thing just stopped

1411
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,999
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1412
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:32,718
What do we got?

1413
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,916
Whatever signal it was sending
finally crapped out.

1414
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,256
I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1415
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,280
We did.

1416
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:41,274
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1417
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:43,919
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1418
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,520
We don't even know
what this is.

1419
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:48,070
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1420
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,875
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1421
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,509
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1422
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:57,874
Where's Fury?
